</div>

<p class='c004'>In presenting the second volume of this attempt, I feel no
compunction, and offer no apology, for what may seem to some
the surprisingly large space given to English critics. That the
book itself is intended primarily for English readers would be
but a poor-spirited plea; and the greatness of English literature
as a whole, though a worthier, is still an unnecessary argument.
For the fact is, that the positive value and importance of
English criticism itself are far greater than has been usually
allowed. Owing very mainly to the not unintelligible or inexcusable,
but unfortunate, initiative of Mr Matthew Arnold, it
has become a fashion to speak of this branch of our national
literature, if not even of the function of the national genius
which it expresses, with bated breath, and with humble acknowledgment
of the superiority of German, and still more of French,
critics. This superiority, I say without the slightest fear, is a
fond thing vainly invented. English criticism was rather late,
and for a long time rather intermittent; nor did it fail, after
the manner of the nation, to derive fresh impulses and new
departures in the sixteenth century from Italian, in the seventeenth
and again in the nineteenth century from French, and
at the end of the eighteenth from German. But it is not true
that in so much as one of these cases it was contented slavishly
to imitate; and it is not true that, with the doubtful exception
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>of Sainte-Beuve, foreign countries have had any critics greater
than our own, while they have, even put together, hardly so
many great ones. In everything but mere superficial consistency
Dryden is a head and shoulders above Boileau as a critic;
Coleridge a head, shoulders, and body above the Schlegels, whom
he followed. Long before Sainte-Beuve, Hazlitt had shown a
genius for real criticism, as distinguished from barren formula-making,
which no critic has surpassed. And Mr Arnold himself,
with less range, equity, and sureness than Sainte-Beuve,
has a finer literary taste and touch. As for that <em>general</em> superiority
of French criticism of which we have heard so much, the
unerring voice of actual history will tell us that it never existed
at all, except, perhaps, for a generation before 1660, and a
generation before 1860, the latter being the period which called
forth, but misled, Mr Arnold’s admiration. With this last we
do not here deal; nor with the Romantic revolt, in dealing with
which it will be pertinent to appraise the relative excellence
of Lessing and Goethe as compared with Coleridge and Hazlitt.
But we have within our present range an almost better field of
comparison, in that “neo-classic” period from Boileau to La
Harpe, and from Dryden to Johnson, in which, on the whole,
and taking recognised orthodoxy only, the critics of France and
of England worshipped the same idols, subscribed the same
confessions of faith, and to no small extent even applied their
principles to the same texts and subjects. I am, after careful
examination, certain myself, and I hope that the results of
that examination may make it clear to others, that they did
<em>not</em> “order these things better in France,” that they did not
order them nearly so well.</p>

<p class='c000'>The subject of this volume has more unity than that of the
last; and I have thought it permissible to avail myself of this
fact in the arrangement of the Interchapters. The whole of
so-called Classical or Neo-classic Criticism is so intimately connected
that almost any of its characteristic documents from
Vida to La Harpe might be made the text of a sermon on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>entire phenomenon in its complete development. And in the
same way, though with an opposite effect, all general comment
might, without any grave historical or logical impropriety, have
been postponed to the end of the volume. But this would, in
the first place, have broken the uniformity of the book; in the
second, it would have necessitated a final Interchapter (or
“inter-conclusion”) of portentous and disproportionate length;
and in the third, it would have too long withheld from the
reader those resting-places and intermediate views, as from
various stations on Pisgah, which seem to me to be the great
advantages and conveniences of the arrangement. I have therefore,
while keeping the historical character and distribution of
the summaries of the three centuries which happen pretty
accurately to coincide with the three stages of the whole phase,
made the logical gist of the first to concern chiefly the rise of
the classical-critical attitude; of the second that constituted
creed or code which was explicitly assented to, or implicitly
accepted, by the entire period except in the case of rebels;
while in the third I have concentrated criticism of this criticism
as a whole. The three Interchapters are thus in manner consecutive
and interdependent; but they will, I hope, serve not
less to connect and illuminate the contents of the several books
and of the whole volume than to conduct the story and the
argument of the entire work duly from the beginning to the
end of the appointed stage. They are perhaps specially important
here because of the mass and number of minor figures with
whom I have had to deal. I know that some excellent judges
dislike this <span lang="la"><i>numerus</i></span> and would have attention concentrated on
the chiefs. But that is not my conception of literary history.</p>

<p class='c000'>After full consideration of the matter, I have thought it better
not to attempt any comment on criticisms of the first volume
of this <cite>History of Criticism</cite>. I am much indebted to many
of my critics, and perhaps I may be permitted to say that I
was not a little surprised, and, to speak as a fool, very much
pleased, by the generally favourable reception given to, rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>than deserved by, an undoubtedly audacious undertaking. In
cases where those critics obliged me with a substantive correction
(as, for instance, in that relating to Trissino’s version of the
<span lang="la"><cite>De Vulgari Eloquio</cite></span>, v. <i>infra</i>, p. 40), I have taken opportunity,
wherever it was possible, to acknowledge the obligation, and I
subjoin some <span lang="la"><i>corrigenda</i></span> and <span lang="la"><i>addenda</i></span> in a flyleaf. But beyond
this I do not think it desirable to go. In the case of merely
snarling or carping censure, the conduct of Johnson as regards
Kenrick gives the absolute precedent, even for those who have
to acknowledge how far nearer their censors have come to
Kenrick than they themselves can ever hope to come to Johnson.
To those who pronounce a task impossible the best answer
is to go and do it; to those who object to style and manner
one may once more plead those disabilities of <span lang="fr"><cite>la plus belle fille de
France</cite></span> which attach also to those who are neither French, nor
girls, nor beautiful; for those who hate jokes and literary
allusions one can only pray, “God help them!” And in the
case of <em>bona fide</em> misunderstanding the wisest thing for an author
to do is to make his meaning plainer, if he can, in the rest of
his book.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would probably be still more idle to attempt to anticipate
strictures on the present volume. That its subject might
advantageously have been dealt with in twice or thrice the
space is obvious, and perhaps I may say without impropriety
that the writer could have so treated it with no additional
labour except the mere writing—for the preparation necessitated
would have sufficed for half-a-dozen volumes. But to keep
proportion, and observe the plan, is one of those critical warnings
to which Classic and Romantic alike had much better
attend. In the division which I have adopted of eighteenth-century
writers into those who, as adherents of Neo-Classicism,
are to be treated here, and those who, as forerunners or actual
exponents of Modern Criticism, are to be reserved for our next,
there must necessarily be much which invites cavil, and not a
little which excuses objection. I shall only say that the distribution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>has not been made hastily; and that it may be possible
to make its principle clearer when the reserved writers have
been treated. The advantage of keeping the subject of the
volume as homogeneous as possible seemed paramount.</p>

<p class='c000'>In writing Vol. I. it was possible, with rare exceptions, to rely
upon texts in my own possession. This has, of course, here
been impossible: though I possess a fair collection of the
Italians of the Renaissance, while I have long had many of the
French and English writers of the whole time. For the supply
of deficiencies I have not only to make the usual acknowledgment
to the authorities of the British Museum—than which
surely no institution ever better deserved the patronage of its
name-giving goddesses—but also to thank those of the libraries
belonging to the Faculty of Advocates and the Society of
Writers to the Signet in Edinburgh, which bodies admit others
besides their own members with remarkable liberality. In the
library of the University of Edinburgh I suppose I may consider
myself at home; but I owe cordial thanks to Bodley’s
Librarian, to the University Librarian at Cambridge, and to the
librarian of the John Rylands collection at Manchester, for
information about books which I have been unable to find
elsewhere. There are one or two mentioned in the notes which
I have not been able to get hold of yet; and I shall be extremely
obliged to any reader of this history who may happen to know
their whereabouts, and will take the trouble to tell me of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am only the Satan of this journey across Chaos, and I daresay
I have been driven out of the best course by the impact of
more than one nitrous cloud. In other words, I not merely
daresay, but am pretty sure, that I have made some blunders,
especially in summary of readings not always controllable by
reference to the actual books when the matter came before me
again in print. And I daresay, further, that these will be
obvious enough to specialists. I have found some such blunders
even in the first volume, where the literature of the subject was
far less extensive and, even in proportion to its extent, far more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>accessible; and I have thought it best to include corrections
of some of these in the present volume, in order that those who
already possess the first may not be in an inferior position to
those who acquire the new edition of it which is, or will shortly
be, ready. When the work reaches its close (if it ever does so)
will be the proper time to digest and incorporate these alterations
as Fortune may allow. The kindness of Professor Elton,
King Alfred Professor of English in University College, Liverpool,
of Professor Ker <em>iterum</em>, and of my colleague Mr Gregory
Smith, has beyond all doubt enabled me to forestall some part of
these corrections in regard to the present volume. These friends
were obliging enough to undertake between them the reading
of the whole; others have assisted me on particular points, in
regard to most of which I have, I think, made due acknowledgment
in the notes. As before, I have taken some trouble with
the Index, and I hope it may be found useful.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>ADDENDA AND CORRIGENDA TO VOLUME II.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>P. <a href='#Page_23'>23</a> <i>sq.</i> A reference of Hallam’s (<cite>Literature of Europe</cite>, iii. 5, 76, 77) to
the <cite>Miscellanies</cite> of Politian has led some critics, who apparently do not know
the book itself, and have not even read Hallam carefully, to object to its
omission here. Their authority might have saved them; for he very correctly
describes these <cite>Miscellanies</cite> as “sometimes grammatical, but more frequently
relating to obscure customs and mythological allusions.” In other words, the
book—which <em>I</em> have read—is hardly, in my sense, critical at all.</p>

<p class='c000'>P. <a href='#f107'>80, note</a>. When I wrote on Castelvetro I was not aware that the
Commentary on Dante (at least that on <cite>Inf.</cite>, Cantos i.-xxix.) had been recovered
and published by Signor Giovanni Franciosi (Modena, 1886) in a stately royal
4to (which I have now read, and possess), with the owl and the pitcher, but
without the <em>Kekrika</em>, and without the proper resolution in the owl’s countenance.
This may be metaphysically connected with the fact that the editor is rather
unhappy about his author, and tells us that he was long in two minds about
sending him out at last to the world. He admires Castelvetro’s boldness,
scholarship, intellect; but thinks him sadly destitute of reverence for Dante,
and deplores his “lack of lively and cheerful sense of the Beautiful.” If it
were not that my gratitude to the man who gives me a text seals my mouth
as to everything else, I should be a little inclined to cry “Fudge!” at this.
Nobody would expect from any Renaissance scholar, and least of all from
Castelvetro, “unction,” mysticism, rapture at the things that give <em>us</em> rapture
in Dante. All the more honour to him that, as in the case of Petrarch, he
thought it worth while to bestow on that vernacular, which too many Renaissance
scholars despised, the same intense desire to understand, the same
pains, the same “taking seriously,” which he showed towards the ancients.
This is the true reverence: the rest is but “leather and prunella.”</p>

<p class='c000'>P. <a href='#Page_107'>107</a>. Some time after vol. ii. was published I came across (in the catalogues
of Mr Voynich, who might really inscribe on these documents for motto</p>

<p class='c008'>quite a nest of Zinanos, mostly written about that year 1590, which seems to
have been this curious writer’s most active time; and I bought two of them
as specially appurtenant to our subject. One is a <span lang="it"><cite>Discorso della Tragedia</cite></span>,
appended (though separately paged and dedicated) to the author’s tragedy of
<span lang="it"><cite>Almerigo</cite></span>; the other <span lang="it"><cite>Le Due Giornate della Ninfa overo del Diletto e delle Muse</cite></span>,
all printed by Bartholi, at Reggio, and the two prose books or booklets dated
1590. The <span lang="it"><cite>Discorso</cite></span> is chiefly occupied with an attack on the position that
Tragedy (especially according to Aristotle) ought to be busied with true subjects
only. The <span lang="it"><cite>Giornate</cite></span> (which contain another reference to Patrizzi) deal—more
or less fancifully, but in a manner following Boethius, which is interesting at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>so late a date—with philosophy and things in general, rather than with
literature.</p>

<p class='c000'>P. <a href='#Page_322'>322</a>, bk. IV. chap. i. I ought, perhaps, to have noticed in this context
a book rather widely spread—Sorel’s <span lang="fr"><cite>De La Connaissance des Bons Livres</cite></span>, Paris,
1671. It contains some not uninteresting things on literature in general, on
novels, poetry, comedy, &#38;c., on the laws of good speaking and writing, on the
“new language of French.” But it is, on the whole, as anybody acquainted with
any part of the voluminous work of the author of <span lang="fr"><cite>Francion</cite></span> would expect, mainly
not disagreeable nor ignorant <em>chat</em>—newspaper work before the newspaper.</p>

<p class='c000'>P. <a href='#Page_350'>350</a>. The opposition of the two “doctors” is perhaps too sharply put.</p>

<p class='c000'>P. <a href='#Page_436'>436</a>. I should like to add as a special “place” for Dennis’s criticism, his
comparatively early <i>Remarks on</i> Prince Arthur <i>and Virgil</i> (title abbreviated),
London, 1696. It is, as it stands, of some elaboration; but its author tells
us that he “meant” to do things which would have made it an almost complete
Poetic from his point of view. It is pervaded with that refrain of “this <em>ought</em>
to be” and “that <em>must</em> have been” to which I have referred in the text; and
bristles with purely arbitrary preceptist statements, such as that Criticism cannot
be ill-natured because Good Nature in man cannot be contrary to Justice and
Reason; that a man must not like what he ought not to like—a doctrine underlying,
of course, the whole Neo-classic teaching, and not that only; almost literally
cropping up in Wordsworth; and the very formulation, in categorical-imperative,
of La Harpe’s “monstrous beauty.” The book (in which poet and critic are
very comfortably and equally yoked together) is full of agreeable things; and
may possibly have suggested one of Swift’s most exquisite pieces of irony in its
contention that Mr Blackmore’s Celestial Machines are directly contrary to the
Doctrine of the Church of England.</p>

<p class='c000'>P. <a href='#Page_546'>546</a>. Denina. This author is a good instance of the things which the
reader sometimes rather reproachfully demands, when the writer would only
too fain have supplied them. I could write more than a page with satisfaction
on Denina’s <span lang="it"><cite>Discorso sopra le Vicende della Litteratura</cite></span>, which, rather surprisingly,
underwent its second edition in Glasgow at the Foulis press (1763), and which
not only deals at large with the subject in an interesting manner, but accepts
the <span lang="la"><i>religio loci</i></span> by dealing specially with <em>Scottish</em> literature. But, once more, this
is for a fourth volume—or even a fifth—things belonging to the Thinkable-Unthinkable.</p>

<p class='c004'>We saw, in the second section of the Interchapter which served
as Conclusion to the first volume of this work, to what a point
<span class='sni side12'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Critical starting-point of the Renaissance.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the Middle Ages had brought the materials and the
methods of Literary Criticism, and what the new
age with its combined opportunities might have
done.  We also endeavoured to indicate generally,
and so to speak, proleptically, what it did <em>not</em> do. It is now
time to examine what it did: and in the course of the examination
to develop the reasons, the character, and the consequences,
both of its commission and of its abstention.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c019'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>If no period has ever been more guilty of that too usual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>injustice to predecessors which we noted, it is fair to acknowledge
that none had greater temptations to such injustice. The
breach between the Classical and the Dark Ages had been
almost astonishingly gradual—so gradual that it has needed no
great hardiness of paradox to enable men to deny that there
was any breach at all. On the other hand, though the breach
at the Renaissance<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c019'><sup>[2]</sup></a> is capable of being, and has sometimes been,
much exaggerated; though it was preceded by a considerable
transition period, and though mediæval characteristics survived
it long and far, yet the turning over of the new leaf is again
incontestable, and was as necessary in the order of thought as
it is certain in the sequence of fact.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not much more than a hundred years since the French
Revolution, a single event in one department only of things
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Influences at work: General.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
actual, was sufficient to precipitate a change which
is only less—which some would hold likely to be not
less—than the change at the beginning of the Dark
Ages, and the change at the end of the Middle. At the Renaissance,
not one but three or four such events, in as many different
departments, brought their shock to bear upon the life and mind
of Europe. The final disappearance of the Eastern Empire, and
the apparent—perhaps, indeed, a little more than apparent—danger
of a wide and considerable barbarian invasion of even
Western Europe, with the balancing of this after a sort a little
later by the extinction of the Moorish power in Spain, coincided,
as regards politics, with a general tendency throughout Europe
towards the change of feudal into centralised monarchy. The determination
(resulting no doubt from no single cause, and taking
effect after long preparation) of direct, practical, and extensive
study to the Classics, especially to Greek, affected not merely
literature, but almost everything of which literature treats. The
invention of printing enormously facilitated, not merely the study
but, the diffusion and propagation of ideas and patterns. The
discovery of America, and of the sea-route to the East, excited that
spirit of exploration and adventure which, once aroused, is sure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>not to limit itself to the material world. And, lastly, the long-threatened
and at last realised protest against the corruptions of
the Christian Church, and the domination of the Pope, unsettled,
directly or indirectly, every convention, every compromise, every
accepted doctrine. In fact, to use the words of one of the
greatest of English writers,<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c019'><sup>[3]</sup></a> in what is perhaps his most brilliant
passage, “in the fabric of habit which they had so laboriously
built for themselves, men could remain no longer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Their critical habits, as we have seen sufficiently in the last
Book, had been mainly negative; and for this reason, if for
no other, a considerable critical development would have been
certain to spring up. But there were other reasons, and powerful
ones. In the first place, the atmosphere of revolt which was
abroad necessarily breeds, or rather necessarily implies, criticism.
A few, whom the equal Jove has loved, may be able to criticise
while acquiescing, approving, even loving and strenuously
championing; but this equity is not exceedingly common, and
the general tendency of acceptance, and even of acquiescence, is
distinctly uncritical. On the other hand, the rebel is driven
either to his rebellion by the exercise of his critical faculty, or
to the exercise of his critical faculty in order to justify his
rebellion. I do not myself hold that the Devil was the first
critic. I have not the slightest desire to serve myself and my
subject heirs to that spirit unfortunate; but I recognise the
necessity of some argument to rebut the filiation.</p>

<p class='c000'>And that these generalities should become particular in reference
to Literary Criticism more especially, there were additional
and momentous inducements of two different kinds.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Particular.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In the first place, the malcontents with the immediate
past must in any case have been drawn to attack the
literary side of its battlements, because of their extreme weakness.
Everywhere but in the two extremities of the West, Italy
and Scotland (the latter, owing to the very small bulk of its
literary production, and the rudimentary condition of its language,
being hardly an exception at all), the fifteenth century,
even with a generous eking from the earliest sixteenth, had
been a time of literary torpor and literary decadence, relieved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>only by a few—a very few—brilliant individual performances.
In England the successors of Chaucer, not content with carrying
his method and his choice of subject no further, had almost
incomprehensibly lost command of both. In France the <span lang="fr"><i>rhétoriqueur</i></span>
school of poets had degenerated less in form, but had
been almost equally unable to show any progress, or even any
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Weakness of Vernaculars.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
maintained command, of matter. Germany was far
worse than either. If Chaucer himself could criticise,
indirectly but openly, the faults of the still vigorous
and beautiful romance—of the romance which in his own
country was yet to boast Chester in verse and Malory in prose—how
much more must any one with sharp sense and sound
taste, at the beginning of the sixteenth century, have been
tempted to apply some similar process to the fossilised formalism
of <span lang="fr"><i>rondeau</i></span> and <span lang="fr"><i>ballade</i></span>; to the lifeless and lumbering allegory
of the latest “Rose” imitations; to the “aureate,” or rather
tinselled, bombast of Chastellain and Robertet?</p>

<p class='c000'>But, as it happened, no inconsiderable part of the newly disinterred
classics dealt with this very subject of Literary Criticism,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Recovery of Ancient Criticism.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and, having been most neglected, was certain to
be most attended to. Later mediæval practice had
provided the examples of disease: earlier classical
theory was to provide the remedy. Plato, the most cherished
of the recovered treasures, had—in his own peculiar way, no
doubt—criticised very largely; the <cite>Poetics</cite> and the <cite>Rhetoric</cite>
were quickly set afresh before the new age in the originals;
Horace had always been known; Quintilian was, since Rhetoric
had not yet fallen into disfavour, studied direct;<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c019'><sup>[4]</sup></a> and, before the
sixteenth century was half over, Longinus himself had been unearthed
and presented to a world which (if it had chosen to
attend thereto) was also for the first time furnished with Dante’s
critical performance.<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c019'><sup>[5]</sup></a> With such an arsenal; with such a disposition
of mind abroad; and with such real or imagined enemies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>to attack, it would have been odd if the forces of criticism,
so long disorganised, and indeed disembodied, had not taken
formidable shape.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was, however, yet another influence which is not very
easy to estimate, and which has sometimes perhaps been not
quite rightly estimated, but which undoubtedly had
a great deal to do with the matter. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Necessity of defence against Puritanism.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Almost as soon
as—almost before indeed—the main battle of the
Renaissance engaged itself, certain phenomena, not
unusual in similar cases, made their appearance. Men of
letters, humanists, students, were necessarily the protagonists
of revolt or reform. There had always, as we have seen, been
a certain jealousy of Letters on the part of the Church; and
this was not likely to be lessened in the new arrangement
of circumstance. But the jealousy was by no means confined
to the party of order and of the defence. It had been necessary,
or it would have had no rank-and-file, for the attack to enlist
the descendants of the old Lollards and other opponents of the
Romish Church in different countries. But in these, to no
small extent, and in men like Calvin, when they made their
appearance, perhaps still more, the Puritan dislike of Art, and
of Literature as part of Art, was even more rampant than in
the obscurest of <span lang="la"><i>obscuri viri</i></span> on the Catholic and Conservative
side. And so men of letters had not merely to attack what
they thought unworthy and obsolete foes of literature, but to
defend literature itself from their own political and ecclesiastical
allies.</p>

<p class='c000'>The line which they took had been taken before, and was no
doubt partly suggested to them by Boccaccio in the remarkable
book already referred to<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c019'><sup>[6]</sup></a>—the <span lang="la"><cite>De Genealogia Deorum</cite></span>—which
was repeatedly printed in the early days of
the press. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The line of criticism resultant.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> There can be very little question that
this anticipates the peculiar tone of what we may call anti-Platonic
Platonism, which is so noticeable in the Italian critics
of the Renaissance, and which was caught from them by
Englishmen of great note and worth, from Sidney to Milton.
The excellent historian of the subject—whom I have already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>quoted, and my indebtedness to whom must not be supposed
to be repudiated because I cannot agree with him on some
important points—is, I think, entirely wrong in speaking of
mediæval “distrust of literature,” while the statement with
which he supports this, that “popular literature had fallen into
decay, and, in its contemporary form, was beneath serious consideration,”<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c019'><sup>[7]</sup></a>
is so astonishing, that I fear we must class it with
those <span lang="la"><i>judicia ignorantium</i></span> of which our general motto speaks.
In his context Mr Spingarn mentions, as examples of mediæval
treatment of literature, Fulgentius, Isidore, John of Salisbury,
Dante, Boccaccio. What “popular” (by which I presume is
meant vernacular) literature was there in the times of Fulgentius
or of Isidore? Is not the statement that “popular literature
had fallen into decay” in the time of Dante self-exploded?
And the same may be said of Boccaccio. As for John of
Salisbury, he certainly, as we have seen,<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c019'><sup>[8]</sup></a> was not much of a
critic himself; but that popular literature was decaying in his
time is a statement which no one who knows the <span lang="fr"><cite>Chansons de
Gestes</cite></span> and the Arthurian Legend can accept for one moment;
while the documents also quoted <i>supra</i>, the <span lang="la"><cite>Labyrinthus</cite></span>, the
<span lang="la"><cite>Nova Poetria</cite></span>, and the rest—entirely disprove any “distrust” of
letters.</p>

<p class='c000'>The truth is, with submission to Mr Spingarn, that there never
was any such, except from the Puritan-religious side, and that
this was by no means specially conspicuous in the
Middle Ages. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Not necessarily anti-mediæval,</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The “Defence of Poesy,” and of literature
generally, which animates men so different as
Boccaccio and Milton, as Scaliger and Sidney, is no direct revolt
against the Middle Ages at all, but, as has been said, a discourse
<span lang="la"><cite>Pro Domo</cite></span>, in the first place, against the severer and more
obscurantist partisans of Catholicism, who were disposed to
dislike men of letters as Reformers, and literature as the instrument
of Reformation; secondly, and much more urgently,
against the Puritan and Philistine variety of Protestantism
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>itself, which so soon turned against its literary leaders and
allies. And the special form which this defence took was in
turn mainly conditioned, not by anti-mediæval animus, but in
part by the circumstances of the case, in part by the character
of the critical weapons which men found in their new arsenal
of the Classics.</p>

<p class='c000'>Classical Criticism, as we have seen in the preceding volume,
had invariably in theory, and almost as invariably in practice,
confined itself wholly or mainly to the consideration
of “the subject.” <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>but classical</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Although Aristotle himself had not
denied the special pleasure of art and the various kinds of art,
although Plato, in distrusting and denouncing, had admitted
the psychagogic faculties thereof; yet nobody except Longinus
had boldly identified the chief end of it with “transport,”
not with persuasion, with edification, or anything of the kind.
Accordingly, those who looked to the ancients to help them
against the <span lang="la"><cite>Obscuri Viri</cite></span> on the one hand, and against good
Puritan folk like our own Ascham on the other, were almost
bound to keep the <em>pleasure</em> of poetry and literature generally
in the background; or, if they brought it to the front at all, to
extol it and defend it on ethical and philosophical, not on
æsthetic grounds. Taking a hint from their “sweet enemy”
Plato, from Plutarch, and from such neo-Platonic utterances as
that tractate of Plotinus, which has been discussed in its place,<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c019'><sup>[9]</sup></a>
they set themselves to prove that poetry was <em>not</em> a sweet
pleasant deceit or corrupting influence in the republic, but a
stronghold and rampart of religious and philosophical truth.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>and anti-Puritan.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Calling in turn Aristotle to their assistance, and working him
in with his master and rival, they dwelt with redoubled
and at length altogether misleading and
misled energy on “Action,” “Unity,” and the like.
And when they did consider form it was, always or too often,
from the belittling point of view of the ancients themselves in
spirit, and from the meticulous point of view of Horace (who
had always been known) in detail. Here and there in such a
man as Erasmus (v. <i>infra</i>), who was nothing if not sensible, we
find the Gellian and Macrobian particularisms taken up with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>really progressive twist towards inquiry as to the bearing of
these particularities on the pleasure of the reader. But Erasmus
was writing in the “false dawn”; the Puritan tyranny of
Protestantism on the one side, and of the Catholic revival
on the other, had not brought back a partial night as yet;
and some of the best as well as some of the worst characteristics
of the new age inclined those of his immediate successors
rather than contemporaries, who adopted criticism directly, to
quite different ways.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would, however, be a glaring omission if the critical
position of Erasmus himself were not set forth at some
length.<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c019'><sup>[10]</sup></a>
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Erasmus.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Standing as he does, the most eminent
literary figure of Europe on the bridge of the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, nothing if not critical as
he is in his general temperament, and on the textual and
exegetical, if not on the strictly literary sides of the Art, one
of its great historical figures—his absence from this gallery
would be justly regarded as inexcusable. And if his voluminous
work does not yield us very much within the more special and
fully enfranchising lines of our system, it might be regarded as
a sufficient answer to say that the imperfection of the vernaculars,
his own concentration on particular forms of Biblical and
patristic text-criticism, and that peculiar cosmopolitanism which
made him practically of no country at all, served to draw him
away from a practice in which he would, but for these circumstances
and conditions, have certainly indulged.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may, however, be doubted whether Erasmus would ever
have made a capital figure as a purely literary critic. Very
great man of letters as he was, and almost wholly literary as
were his interests, those interests were suspiciously directed
towards the applied rather than the pure aspects of literature—were,
in short, <span lang="la"><i>per se</i></span> rather scientific than literary proper. It
is at least noteworthy that the <span lang="la"><cite>Ciceronianus</cite></span> (though Erasmus
was undoubtedly on the right side in it) was directed against a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>purely literary folly, against an exaggeration of one of the
tastes and appetites which spur on the critic. And it is almost
enough to read the <span lang="la"><cite>Adagia</cite></span> and <span lang="la"><cite>Apophthegmata</cite></span>—books much
forgotten now, but written with enormous zest and pains by
him, and received with corresponding attention and respect
by two whole centuries at least—to see how much is there
left out which a literary critic <span lang="fr"><i>pur sang</i></span> could not but have
said.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <span lang="la"><cite>Ciceronianus</cite></span>, however, must receive a little fuller treatment,
both because of its intimate connection with our subject,
and because hardly any work of Erasmus, except the
<cite>Colloquies</cite>, so definitely estates him in the new position
of critical man of letters, as distinguished from
that of philosophical or rhetorical teacher. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Ciceronianus.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The piece<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c019'><sup>[11]</sup></a> (which
has for its second title <span lang="la"><cite>De Optimo Dicendi Genere</cite></span>) did not appear,
and could not have appeared, very early in his career. He
might even, in the earlier part of that career, have been slow to
recognise the popular exaggeration which, as in the other
matter of the Reformation itself, struck his maturer intelligence.
He glances at its genesis in divers of his letters, to
Budæus, to Alciatus, and others, from 1527 onwards, and the
chief “begetter” of it seems to have been the Flemish scholar,
Longolius (Christophe de Longueil), who during the latter part
of his short life was actually very much such a fanatic as the
Nosoponus of the dialogue. This person is described by his
friends Bulephorus and Hypologus as <span lang="la"><i>olim rubicundulus, obesulus,
Veneribus et gratiis undique scatens</i></span>, but now an austere
shadow, who has no aspiration in life but to be “Ciceronian.”
In order to achieve this distinction, he has given his days and
nights wholly to the study of Cicero. The “copy” of his
Ciceronian lexicon would already overload two stout porters.
He has noted the differing sense of every word, whether alone
or in context; and by the actual occurrence, not merely of the
word itself, but of its form and case, he will be absolutely
governed. Thus, if you are to be a true Ciceronian, you may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>say <span lang="la"><i>ornatus</i></span> and <span lang="la"><i>ornatissimus</i></span>, but not <span lang="la"><i>ornatior</i></span>; while, though
<span lang="la"><i>nasutus</i></span> is permitted to you, both comparative and superlative
are barred. In the same way, he will only pass the actual
cases and numbers found in the Arpinate; though every one
but, let us say, the dative plural occurs, the faithful must not
presume to usurp that dative. Further, he intends to reduce
the whole of Cicero to quantitative rhythm, fully specified; and
in his own writing he thinks he has done well if he accomplishes
one short period in a winter night. The piece begins with the
characteristic Erasmian banter,—Nosoponus is a bachelor, and
Bulephorus observes that it is just as well, for <em>his</em> wife would in
the circumstances either make an irruption into the study, and
turn it topsy-turvy, or console herself with somebody else in
some other place,—but by degrees becomes more serious, and
ends with a sort of adjustment of most ancient and many
modern Latin writers to the Ciceronian point of view.</p>

<p class='c000'>That Erasmus, with his usual shrewdness, hits the great
blot of the time—the merely literal and “Capernaite” interpretation
of the classics—is perhaps less surprising than that
he should hit such much later crazes as the Flaubertian devotion
of a night to a clause, and the still prevalent reluctance of
many really literary persons to allow a reasonable analogy and
extension from the actual practice of authority. It was inevitable
that he should offend the pedants (from Scaliger downwards),
and be attacked by them with the usual scurrility; and
it is not quite certain that any but very few of his readers
thoroughly sympathised with him. In this as in other matters
he was not so much before his time (for the time of the wise
is a <span lang="la"><i>nunc stans</i></span>), as outside of the time of his contemporaries.
But even here we see that he was still of that time as well.
He has no real sympathy with the vernaculars, nor any comprehension
of the fact that they are on equal literary terms
with the classical tongues; and even in regard to this—even
when he is vindicating the freedom of the letter—his thoughts
are fixed on the letter mainly.</p>

<p class='c000'>That it was better so, there can be no doubt. Literary criticism
proper could wait: correction of the mediæval habit of indiscriminate
acceptance of texts could not. And still, as it is, we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>have from Erasmus not a little agreeable material of that kind
which we have sedulously gathered in the preceding volume;
which, from men like him, we shall not neglect in this; but
for which there will be decreasingly little and less room, both
here and still more in the “not impossible” third.</p>

<p class='c000'>Considering the very wide range in subject of the <cite>Colloquies</cite>,<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c019'><sup>[12]</sup></a>
it is not quite insignificant that literary matters have but a
small place in them; there is perhaps more significance
still in the nature of the treatment where it
does occur. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Colloquies.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The chief <span lang="la"><i>locus</i></span> is inevitably the <span lang="la"><cite>Convivium Poeticum</cite></span>,
where, except the account of the feast itself, and the excellent
by-play with the termagant <span lang="fr"><i>gouvernante</i></span> Margaret, the whole
piece is literary, and in a manner critical. But the manner is
wholly verbal; or else concerned with the very mint and anise
of form. A various reading in Terence from a codex of Linacre’s;
the possibility of eliding or slurring the consonantal <i>v</i>;
whether <span lang="la"><i>Exilis</i></span> in the Palinode to Canidia is a noun or a verb;
whether the Ambrosian rhymes are to be scanned on strict
metrical principles; the mistakes made by Latin translators of
Aristotle,—this is the <span lang="la"><i>farrago libelluli</i></span>. I must particularly beg
to be understood as not in the least slighting these discussions.
They had to be done; it is our great debt on this side to the
Renaissance that it got over the doing of them for us in so
many cases; they are the necessary preliminary to all criticism—nay,
they are an important part of criticism itself. But they
are only the rudiments.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <span lang="la"><cite>Concio, sive Merdardus</cite></span>, after an explanation of the offensive
sub-title (which has less of good-humoured superiority,
and more of the snappish Humanist temper, than is usual with
Erasmus), declines into similar matters of reading and rendering—here
in reference not to profane but to sacred literature.
And the curious <span lang="la"><cite>Conflictus Thaliæ et Barbariei</cite></span>, which is more
dramatically arranged than most of the <cite>Colloquies</cite>, and may even
have taken a hint from the French Morality of <span lang="fr"><cite>Science et Asnerye</cite></span>,<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c019'><sup>[13]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>loses, as it may seem to us, an opportunity of being critical
in the best and real kind. The antagonists exchange a good
deal of abuse, which on Thalia’s part extends to some mediæval
writers cited by Barbaries (among whom our poor old friend
John of Garlandia rather unfairly figures), and the piece, which
is short, ends with a contest in actual citation of verse—Leonine
and scholastic enough on the part of Barbaries, gracefully
enough <em>pastiched</em> from the classics on the part of Thalia. But
Erasmus either deliberately declines, or simply does not perceive,
the opening given for a <em>critical</em> indication of the charms
of purity and the deformities of barbarism.</p>

<p class='c000'>To thread the mighty maze of the <cite>Letters</cite><a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c019'><sup>[14]</sup></a> completely, for the
critical utterances to be picked up there, were more tempting
than strictly incumbent on the present adventurer, who has,
however, not neglected a reasonable essay at the adventure.
The adroit and good-humoured attempt to soothe the poetic
discontent of Eobanus Hessus, who thought Erasmus had not
paid him proper attention,<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c019'><sup>[15]</sup></a> contains, for instance, a little matter
of the kind, and several references to contemporary Latin poets.
The most important thing, perhaps, is the opinion—sensible as
usual with the writer—that, as the knowledge of Greek becomes
more and more extended, translation of it into Latin is more
and more lost labour. But Erasmus, as we should expect, evidently
has more at heart the questions of “reading and rendering”
which fill his correspondence with Budæus and others.
To take the matter in order, a curious glimpse of the literary
manners, as well as the literary judgments, of the time is
afforded by an enclosure in a letter to John Watson of Cambridge.
Watson wanted to know what Erasmus had been doing,
and Erasmus, answering indirectly, sends him a letter on the
subject by one Adrian Barland of Louvain to his brother. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Letters.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Some
incidental expressions here about Euripides as <span lang="la"><i>nobilissimus poeta</i></span>,
and Apuleius as producing <span lang="la"><i>pestilentissimas facetias</i></span>, are more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>valuable to us than the copious laudations of Barland on Erasmus’
own work, which pass without any “Spare
my blushes!” from the recipient and transmitter.
We note that the moral point of view is still uppermost,
though the observations are taken from a different angle.
Aristophanes would have regarded Euripides as much more
“pestilent,” morally speaking, than Apuleius. The long and
necessarily complimentary letter (ii. 1) to Leo the Tenth contains
some praise of Politian and much of Jerome, on whom
Erasmus was then engaged; and while the language of this
correspondence naturally abounds in Ciceronian hyperbole, it is
not insignificant that Erasmus describes the Father with the
Lion as <span lang="la"><i>omni in genere litterarum absolutissimus</i></span>, which, assuming
any real meaning in it, is not quite critical, though Jerome was
certainly no small man of letters. The letter to Henry Bovill
(ii. 10), which contains the famous story of “mumpsimus” and
“sumpsimus,” as well as the almost equally famous account of
the studies of the University of Cambridge in the ninth decade
of the fifteenth century, contains also a notable division of his
own critics of the unfavourable kind. They are <span lang="la"><i>aut adeo morosi
ut nihil omnino probent nisi quod ipsi faciunt; aut adeo stolidi ut
nihil sentiant; aut adeo stupidi ut nec legant quod carpunt; aut
adeo indocti ut nihil judicent; aut adeo gloriæ jejuni avidique ut
carpendis aliorum laboribus sibi laudem parent</i></span>. And their children
are alive with us unto this day.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is a very curious, half modest and severe, half confident
criticism of his own verses in ii. 22. He admits that there is
nothing “tumultuous” in them, “no torrent overflowing its
banks,” no <em>deinosis</em>: but claims elegance and Atticism. It
would be perhaps unfair to attach the character of deliberate
critical utterance to his effusive laudation of the style of Colet
in an early letter (v. 4, dated 1498, but Mr Seebohm has thrown
doubt on these dates, and Mr Nichols appears to be completely
redistributing them), as <span lang="la"><i>placidus sedatus inaffectatus, fontis
limpidissimi in morem ditissimo e pectore scatens, æqualis, sui
undique similis, apertus, simplex, modestiæ plenus, nihil usquam
habens scabri contorti conturbati</i></span>. But it is interesting, and significant
of his own performances, as is the comparison (v. 19)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>of Jerome and Cicero as masters of rhetoric. The somewhat
intemperate and promiscuous contempt of mediæval writing
which appears in the <cite>Conflictus</cite> (<span lang="la"><i>vide supra</i></span>) reappears, with the
very same names mentioned, in an epistle (vii. 3), <span lang="la"><cite>Cornelio Suo</cite></span>,
of 1490, which, if it be rightly dated, must be long anterior to
the Colloquy. But a much more important expression of
critical opinion than any of these appears in v. 20 to Ammonius,
where Erasmus gives his views on poetry at large. They
are much what we should suspect or expect beforehand. Some
folk, he says, think that a poem is not a poem unless you poke
in all the gods from heaven, and from earth, and from under
the earth. <em>He</em> has always liked poetry which is at no great
distance from prose—<em>but the best prose</em>.<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c019'><sup>[16]</sup></a> He likes rhetorical
poetry and poetical rhetoric. He does not care for far-fetched
thoughts; let the poet stick to his subject, but give fair attention
to smoothness of versification. “Prose and sense,” in short:
with a little rhetoric and versification added.</p>

<p class='c000'>But on such matters he always touches lightly, and with
little elaboration; and to see where his real interest lay we
have but to turn to the above-quoted verbal discussions with
Budæus on the one hand, to the minute and well-known
account of More’s life and conversation given to Hutten in
x. 30 on the other. Nor do I think that it is worth while
to extend to the remaining two-thirds of the letters the more
exact examination which has here been given to the first third
or thereabouts.<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c019'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Once more, far be it from any reasonable person to blame
Erasmus, or any of his immediate contemporaries, for not doing
what it was not their chief business to do. That chief business,
in the direction of criticism, was to shake off the critical promiscuousness
of the Middle Ages, to insist on the importance
of accurate texts and exact renderings, to stigmatise the actual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>barbarism, the mere <span lang="la"><i>mumpsimus</i></span>, which had no doubt too often
taken the place not only of pure classical Latinity, not only
of the fine if not classical Latin of Tertullian and Augustine
and Jerome, but of that exquisite “sport” the Latin of the
early Middle Age hymns, to hammer Greek into men’s heads
(or elsewhere), to clear up the confusion of dates and times and
values, which had put the false Callisthenes on a level with
Arrian, and exalted Dares above Homer. Even the literary
beauty of the classics themselves was not their main affair;—they
had to inculcate school-work rather than University work,
University work rather than the maturer study of literature.
Of the vernaculars it was best that they should say nothing:
for except Italian none was in a very good state, and Humanists
were much more likely to speak unadvisedly with their lips if
they did speak on the subject. They worked their work: well
were it for all if others did the same.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the reasons given, then, Erasmus and those whom he
represents<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c019'><sup>[18]</sup></a> could do little for criticism proper; and for the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Distribution of the Book.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
same (or yet others closely connected) the northern
nations, of whom Erasmus is the most distinguished
literary representative, could for a long time do as
little: while some of them for a much longer did nothing at
all. Of the others, the criticism of Spain, the criticism of
France, and the criticism of England were all borrowed directly
from that of Italy. The Spaniards did not begin till so late
that their results, like those of Opitz and other Germans, cannot
be properly treated till the next Book. France was stirred about
the middle of the century, and England a very little later. These
two countries, therefore, will properly have each its chapter in
the present book. But two of much more importance must first
be given to those Italian developments, in our Art or Study, on
which both French and English criticism are based. The first
will deal with those who write, roundly speaking, before Scaliger;
the second with the work of that redoubted Aristarch, with the
equally—perhaps the more—important name of Castelvetro,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>with the weary wrangle over the <span lang="la"><cite>Gerusalemme Liberata</cite></span> (which,
weary as it is, is the first great critical debate over a contemporary
vernacular work of importance, and therefore within
measure not to be missed by us), and with certain of the later
Italian critical theorists, of the sixteenth and earliest seventeenth
century, who are valuable, some as continuing, some
as more or less ineffectually fighting against, the neo-classic
domination.</p>

GREAT HISTORIC VALUE.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is not necessary to discuss, or even to expose at any length,
the causes of the relative precocity of Italian Criticism in the
Renaissance. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The beginnings.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> They are practically all contained in,
and can by the very slightest expense of learning
and intelligence be extracted from, the fact that
Italy was at once the cradle of Humanist study of the Classics,
and the only country in Europe which possessed a fully developed
vernacular. But for the greater part of the fifteenth
century attention was diverted from actual criticism—except
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>of the validating or invalidating kind—by the prior and eagerer
appetite for the discovery, study, and popularising, by translation
and otherwise, of the actual authors and texts. For a long
time, indeed, this appetite showed the usual promiscuity of
such affections; and it was scarcely till the time of Vittorino da
Feltre that much critical discrimination of styles was introduced.
But these and other kindred things came surely, and
brought criticism with them, though criticism still generally of
the moral and educational kind. The Boccaccian defence was
taken up by various writers of note—Bruni,<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c019'><sup>[19]</sup></a> Guarino, Æneas
Sylvius—and before the close of the fifteenth century two of
the greatest of Florentines had indicated in different ways the
main lines which Italian criticism was to take. These two were
Savonarola and Politian.</p>

<p class='c000'>The tendency of each could be anticipated by any one who,
though actually ignorant of it, knew the characteristics of the
two men in other ways. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Savonarola.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Fra Girolamo’s, of course,
is wholly ethical-religious, mainly neo-Platonic, but
already presenting the effect of Aristotelian details on the
general Platonic attitude to Poetry. Yet he is still scholastic in
his general treatment of the subject, and still adopts that close
subordination of poetry to Logic which is as old as Averroes and
Aquinas, and which, odd as it may seem to merely modern
readers, is a very simple matter when examined.<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c019'><sup>[20]</sup></a> He disclaims,
as usual, any attack on poetry itself, urging only the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>abuse of poetry; but he follows Plato in looking more than
askance at it, and Aristotle in denying its necessary association
with verse. The Scriptures are the noblest poetry; all ancient
poetry is doubtfully profitable. In fact, he regards poetry
altogether as specially liable to abuse, and dubiously admissible
into, or certainly to be expelled from, a perfect community,
such as that on which the fancy of the Renaissance was so
much fixed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Savonarola’s remarks, which are contained in his four-book
tractate, <span lang="la"><cite>De Scientiis</cite></span>,<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c019'><sup>[21]</sup></a> are more curious than really important.
Yet they derive some importance from the great name and influence
of their propounder, from his position at the very watershed,
so to speak, of time in Europe, if not in Italy, dividing
Middle Age from Renaissance, and from the fact that they
undoubtedly summarise that dubitative, if not utterly hostile,
view of literature in general, and of poetry in particular,
which, as we have seen,<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c019'><sup>[22]</sup></a> was borrowed by the Fathers from
the ancients, and very much intensified by the borrowers. Fra
Girolamo’s attitude is a rigidly scholastic one; and to those who
omit to take account of this, or do not understand it, his view
must seem wholly out of focus, if not wholly obscure. Poetry
is a part of Rational Philosophy; and therefore its object must
be <span lang="la"><i>pars entis rationis</i></span>. It differs from Rhetoric in working
purely by Example, not Enthymeme. Its end is to induce
men to live virtuously by decent representations; and as the
soul loves harmony, it uses harmonic forms. But a poet who
merely knows how to play gracefully with feet only deserves
the name as an old woman deserves that of a pretty girl.<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c019'><sup>[23]</sup></a> Still
more preposterous is the habit of calling poetry “divine.”
Cosmos becomes chaos, if you admit that. <span lang="la"><i>Scientia autem divina
est cujus objectum Deus: non illa cujus objectum exemplum.</i></span> The
making of verses is only poetry <span lang="la"><i>per accidens</i></span>; and as for the
Heathen poets, <span lang="la"><i>magnus diaboli laqueus absconditus est</i></span> in them.
He does not, he says, actually “damn” poetry; but the gist of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>his tractatule is that poets as a rule quite misunderstand their
function, and that poetry had better keep its place, and abstain
from silly, not to say blasphemous, airs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such a point of view was, of course, liable to be taken by
persons alike unlikely to assume the “know-nothing” attitude
of the more ignorant Catholics, the Philistine-Puritan attitude
of Protestantism, or the merely Platonic and non-Christian
theory of some free-thinkers. It might well seem to thoughtful
lovers of literature that its very existence was in danger when
it was attacked from so many sides, and that it was necessary
to intrench it as strongly as possible. Nor were the materials
and the plan of the fortification far to seek. The suggestion has
been rather oddly discovered in the Geographer Strabo;<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c019'><sup>[24]</sup></a> but
authorities much more germane to the matter were at hand.
Boccaccio himself had, as we have seen, both taken note of the
danger and indicated the means of defence: Maximus Tyrius
and Plutarch, the one in a manner more, the other in a manner
less, favourable to poetry, had in effect long before traced out
the whole Camp of Refuge on lines suitable either to the bolder
or to the more timid defender of Poesy. The latter could
represent it as the philosophy of the young, as a sort of
<em>Kindergarten</em>-keeper in the vestibule of the higher mysteries, as
not necessarily bad at all, and possibly very good. The former
could argue for its equality with philosophy itself, as pursuing
the same ends by different means, and appealing, not in the least
<span lang="la"><i>in forma pauperis</i></span>, to its own part of human nature.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seems by no means improbable that this view was
partly brought about by that remarkable influencer both of
early mediæval and of early Renaissance thought,
Dionysius the Areopagite. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Pico, &#38;c.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Readers of Mr Seebohm’s
<cite>Oxford Reformers</cite><a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c019'><sup>[25]</sup></a> will remember the curious and interesting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>extracts there given from Colet’s correspondence with
Radulphus, and the explanation of the Mosaic cosmogony as
intended to present the Divine proceedings “after the manner
of a poet.” This view Colet seems to have extracted partly
from Dionysius himself, partly from Pico della Mirandola, the
most remarkable of Savonarola’s converts, while time and place
are not inconsistent with the belief that the future Dean of St
Paul’s may have come into contact with Fra Girolamo himself.
Now, this kind of envisagement of poetry, certain to turn to
spiritual account in spiritually minded persons like Colet and
Savonarola, and in mystically, if not spiritually, minded ones
like Pico, would, in the general temper of the Renaissance, of
which all three were early illustrations, as certainly turn to
more or less spiritualised philosophy—ethical, metaphysical,
or purely æsthetic, as the case might be. And we can see in it
a <span lang="la"><i>vera causa</i></span> of that certainly excessive, if not altogether mistaken,
devotion to the abstract questions, “What is a poet?”
“What is poetry?” “What is drama?” and so forth, which we
perceive in almost all the Italian critics of the mid-sixteenth
century, and which is almost equally, if less originally, present
in their Elizabethan pupils and followers. If Colet himself
had paid more attention to literature, we cannot doubt that this
is the line which his own literary criticism would have taken;
and as his influence, direct or through Erasmus and More, was
very great on English thought, both at Oxford and Cambridge,
it is not impossible that it may have been exerted in this
very way.</p>

<p class='c000'>The other line (the line which, according to the definitions of
the present work, we must call the line of criticism proper),
though it was perhaps hardly in this instance traced
with boldness and without deflection, started under
yet more distinguished auspices. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Politian.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The <span lang="la"><cite>Sylvæ</cite></span> of Politian consist,
in the main, of a direct critical survey of classical poetry
couched in the, as we may think, somewhat awkward form of
verse, decked with all the ornament that could suggest itself
to the author’s rich, varied, and not seldom really poetical
fancy, and arranged with a view to actual recitation in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>lecture-room for the delight and encouragement of actual
students.<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c019'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Neither purpose nor method can be regarded as wholly
favourable to criticism. The popular <span lang="fr"><i>conférencier</i></span> (for this term
best expresses Politian’s position) is sure to be rather more of a
panegyrist or a detractor, as the case may be, than of a critic;
and the lecturer in verse is sure to be thinking rather of showing
his own rhetorical and poetical gifts than of the strict merits
and defects of his subject. But if we take the <span lang="la"><cite>Nutricia</cite></span> or the
<span lang="la"><cite>Rusticus</cite></span>, the <span lang="la"><cite>Ambra</cite></span> or the <span lang="la"><cite>Manto</cite></span>, and compare any of them
with the well-intentioned summary of the <span lang="la"><cite>Labyrinthus</cite></span>,<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c019'><sup>[27]</sup></a> we
shall see without the least unfairness, and fully admitting the
difference of ability and of opportunity in the two men, the
difference, from the critical point of view, of the two stand-points.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the “Manto,” the first of the <span lang="la"><cite>Sylvæ</cite></span>, the most important
characteristic of sixteenth-century Italian criticism proper, the
exaltation of Virgil, is already prominent. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Manto.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Politian, indeed,
was too much of a wit, and too much of a poet himself,
to let his Virgil-worship take the gross and
prosaic form which it assumed a little later in Vida. But he
has proceeded a long way from the comparatively uncritical
(and yet so more critical) standpoint of Dante. He comes to
details. Cicero had won the palms of sweetness from Nestor
and of tempestuous eloquence from Ulysses (a little vague this),
but Greece consoled herself in poetry. Ennius was too rude
to give Latium the glory of that. Then came Virgil. Even with
the Syracusan reed (<i>i.e.</i>, in his Eclogues) he crushes Hesiod and
contends with Homer. Calliope took him in her arms as an
infant, and kissed him thrice. Manto, the guardian nymph of
his native place, hailed his advent, and summarised in prophetic
detail his achievements in verse. Her town shall enter the
lists—secure of victory—with the seven competitors for Homer’s
origin. And then a whirlwind of magniloquent peroration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>(charged with epanaphora,<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c019'><sup>[28]</sup></a> that favourite figure of the sixteenth
century) extols the poet above all poets and all wonders
of the world, past, present, and to come.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Politian would have been faithful neither to those individual
qualities which have been noted in him, nor to that sworn
service of Greek which was the chivalry of the true
Humanist, if he had thought of depreciating Homer.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Ambra <i>and</i> Rusticus.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The “Ambra,” a poem longer than the “Manto,”
and not much less enthusiastic, is mainly devoted to a fanciful
description of the youth of the poet, and a verse-summary of
the poems. Indeed the peroration (till it is turned into a panegyric
of Ambra, a favourite villa of Lorenzo) is a brilliant,
forcible, and <i>true</i> indication of the enormous debt of all ancient
literature, science, and in fact life, to Homer, of the universality
of his influence, and of the consensus of testimony in his favour.
The “Rusticus” is rather an independent description and panegyric
of country life, as a preface to the reading of Virgil,
Hesiod, and other bucolic and georgic writers, than a criticism
or comparison of them. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Nutricia.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But the “Nutricia” is again ours in
the fullest sense. Its avowed argument is <span lang="la"><cite>De poetica et poetis</cite></span>,
and, in handling this vast and congenial theme, Politian gives the
fullest possible scope at once to his genius, to his learning, and to
that intense love for literature without which learning
is but as the Carlylian “marine-stores.”  In
nearly eight hundred exultant hexameters,<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c019'><sup>[29]</sup></a> the vigour and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>fulness of which enable them to carry off without difficulty the
frippery of their occasional trappings, he traces the origin of
poetry, the transition from mere stupid wonder and the miseries
of barbarism to sacred and profane verse, the elaboration of its
laws in Judea by David and Solomon, in Greece by Orpheus,
the succession of the Greek and Latin poets in the various forms
(it is noteworthy that Politian is not at all copious on the
drama) through the exploits of Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio
to the patronage of poetry by Lorenzo himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is criticism leaning dangerously on the one side to
panegyric, and likely to be (though it is not actually) dragged
to the other still more dangerously by partisanship;
but it is still criticism. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Their merits</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The liker does not “like
grossly,” or in accordance with mere tradition. He loves, as
the American poet says, “not by allowance but with personal
love”; and he can give reasons for the love that is in him.
He seeks the poetic pleasure from the Muse; he obtains it from
her; and he savours it, not merely with eagerness, but with
acutely sensitive taste. Though he might not at some moments
be averse to refining on the character of poetry generally, as
well as on the character of this poetic pleasure, it is this itself
that he seeks, finds, and rejoices in. Part at least of the spirit
of Longinus is on him; he is transported, and he knows the
power that transports.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the same time, it must be difficult, for all but the extremest
Virgilians, to think that he does not err by way of excess in his
estimate of that poet; and it must be still more difficult,
even for them, not to perceive that the pitch,
even if excusable in the individual, is dangerous as an example.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>and danger.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Followers will make-believe; they will give inept reasons to
support their made belief; and worst of all, by that fatal
catachresis of “imitation” which is always waiting upon the
critic, they will begin to think, and to say, that by simply
copying and borrowing from Virgil and other great ones you
may go near to be thought not entirely destitute of their
so-much-praised charm. The danger very soon ceased to be a
danger only, and we find a victim to it in Vida; but before
coming to him we may divagate a little.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>The <span lang="la"><i>furor poeticus</i></span> of Politian put him much beyond other
Humanists in critical respects. His contemporary and friend,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Petrus Crinitus: his</i> De Poetis Latinis.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Petrus Crinitus,<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c019'><sup>[30]</sup></a> was, if not quite of the same caste
as Politian, by no means of the mere ordinary
Humanist type. His kissing-verses, <span lang="la"><cite>Dum te Neæra
savior</cite></span>, are among the best of their kind between
Petronius and Johannes Secundus; and his curious <span lang="fr"><i>pot-pourri</i></span>,
<span lang="la"><cite>De Honesta Sapientia</cite></span>, is quite worth reading, though one may
know most of its constituents well enough beforehand. Yet
the literary inquiries here are surprisingly few, and treated in
no critical spirit whatsoever, so that there is no disappointment
in one sense, though there may be in another, with his three
books, <span lang="la"><cite>De Poetis Latinis</cite></span>. These consist of a large number of
separate articles in more or less chronological order, by no
means ill-written in the classical-dictionary fashion: <span lang="la"><i>Genitus est</i></span>
here; <span lang="la"><i>obiisse traditur</i></span> there, and in such a year; <span lang="la"><i>totum se dicavit
poeticæ facultati</i></span>, and the rest. The taste as expressed by preferences
is not bad, and the approaches (they are hardly more)
to critical estimate, though very obvious and mostly traditional,
are sound enough and fairly supported by quotation. But of
original attempt to grasp and to render the character of Latin
poetry generally, or of any one Latin poet by himself, there is
hardly a vestige.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not at all improbable that <cite>Poetics</cite> in one form or another,
both Italian and “Tedescan,” may exist in MSS. of this period:
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Augustinus Olmucensis: his</i> Defence of Poetry.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
there is certainly work, even in print, of which very
little notice has been taken hitherto. For instance,
a few months ago my friend Mr Gregory Smith saw
in a catalogue, bought, and very kindly lent to me, a
<span lang="la"><cite>Dialogus in Defensionem Poetices</cite></span>, printed at Venice in 1493,
and written by a certain Augustinus Moravus Olmucensis.<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c019'><sup>[31]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>This writer’s family name in vernacular appears to have been
Käsenbrot; and he was one of the early German Humanists
whose most famous chiefs were Reuchlin earlier, Conrad Celtes
and Eobanus Hessus later, who achieved much tolerable verse,
and in the <span lang="la"><cite>Epistolæ Obscurorum</cite></span> one immortal piece of prose,
but who were whelmed in the deluge of the Reformation
struggles, and accomplished little of the good which they might
have done to Germany. The <span lang="la"><cite>Dialogus</cite></span>—which has the perhaps
not quite accidental interest of having appeared in the year
between the writing of Savonarola’s somewhat dubious backing
of Poetry, and the first printing of Boccaccio’s uncompromising
and generous championship thereof—cannot be said to be of
much intrinsic importance. The author gives, or rather adopts,
the definition of Poetry as “a metrical structure of true or
feigned narration, composed in suitable rhythm or feet, and
adjusted to utility <i>and</i> pleasure.” But his text is rather
rambling. A parallel with Medicine (the piece seems to have
been written at Padua, which helps it to its place here) is not
very well worked out, and the latter part is chiefly occupied
with rather dull-fantastic allegorisings of the stories of
Tiresias, the Gorgons, the geography of Hades, and so forth.
Still it is a sign, and welcome as such.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another Transalpine may be admitted here, for reasons
of time rather than of place, to introduce two undoubted
Italians. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Paradoxical attacks on it by Cornelius Agrippa, Landi, Berni.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It is customary to mention the name at
least of Cornelius Agrippa,<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c019'><sup>[32]</sup></a> if not exactly as a critic,
at any rate as being a denouncer, though no mean
practitioner, of literature. It is perhaps a just
punishment for his blasphemy that no one who only knew this
would dream that the adept of Nettesheim was as good a man
of letters as he is. It constitutes the fourth chapter of the <span lang="la"><cite>De
Vanitate Scientiarum</cite></span> (1527), and is a mere piece of hackneyed
railing at the art which <span lang="la"><i>aures stultorum demulcet</i></span>, which is
<span lang="la"><i>architectrix mendaciorum et cultrix perversorum dogmatum</i></span>,
which is <span lang="la"><i>pertenuis et nuda, insulsa, esuriens, famelica</i></span>. Alas! if
some tales are true, Cornelius (who really was a clever man)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>found that Occultism could starve its votaries as well as Poetry.
His attack is, in fact, nothing but an instance of that measles
of the Renaissance (nor of the Renaissance only) paradox-quackery;
and it has no solid foundation whatever. The
later (1543) <span lang="la"><cite>Paradossi</cite></span> of Ortensio Landi<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c019'><sup>[33]</sup></a> exhibit more frankly
the same spirit, but in regard to individuals, especially Aristotle,
rather than to poetry and literature generally. And it is
probably not absent from Berni’s <span lang="la"><cite>Dialogo contra i Poeti</cite></span><a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c019'><sup>[34]</sup></a> (1537,
but written earlier), in which Poetry is dismissed by this
agreeable poet as suitable enough pastime for a gentleman, but
out of the question as a regular vocation or serious business.</p>

<p class='c000'>But we must return to serious persons. Of the critical
texts to which we pay chief attention in this book, there are
not a few which are of far higher critical value than
Vida’s <span lang="la"><cite>Poetics</cite></span>.<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c019'><sup>[35]</sup></a> <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Vida.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But it may be doubted whether
even the similarly named treatises of Aristotle and of Horace
have had a greater actual influence; and I at least am nearly
certain that no modern treatise has had, or has yet had a
chance of having, anything like so much. In the recently
renewed study of Renaissance Criticism there has been, naturally
enough, a repetition of a phenomenon familiar on such
occasions—that is to say, the deflection of attention from pretty
well-known if half-forgotten material to material which had
been still more forgotten, and was hardly known at all.
Daniello, Minturno, and the rest had, since the seventeenth
century, rested almost undisturbed; even Castelvetro and
Scaliger had more or less shrunk to the position of authorities,
of some importance, in regard to ancient criticism. But Vida,
owing to the unmistakable though unacknowledged borrowing
of Boileau, the franker discipleship of Pope, and the inclusion
of a very characteristic translation by Pitt among the usual
collections of “British Poets,” had taken rank once for all. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>is true that it was a rank somewhat of the museum order, but
it existed. Now, the critics who followed him and refined upon
him have been disinterred, and are enjoying their modest
second vogue; and he is comparatively neglected, though a
judicious American<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c019'><sup>[36]</sup></a> has put him in modern dress once more
between his master Horace and his pupil Boileau.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of three things, however, the one is absolutely incontestable
as a fact, and the other two are not easily, I think, to
be gainsaid by competent authority. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Importance of the</i> Poetics.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The first is,
that Vida anticipates in time even the earliest of
the prose critics of the new Italian school by some couple of
years, while he anticipates the main group of these critics
by more than twenty. The second is, that though no doubt he
took some impulse from Politian and other Humanists, he
is practically the first to codify that extravagant Virgil-worship
which reigned throughout the Neo-Classical dispensation.
The third is that, not merely in this point but in
others, he seems, by a sort of intuition, to have anticipated,
at the beginning of the sixteenth century, almost the whole
critical orthodoxy of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth.
It is this which makes the translation of him by Pitt so interesting;
because the translator is, for once, no traitor, but <span lang="fr"><i>plus
royaliste que le roi</i></span>—fanatically imbued with the principles,
and equipped to the finger-tips with the practice, of his original.
But for the purposes of the scholar that original itself must
of course be taken.</p>

<p class='c000'>The temper and the faith in which Vida writes are made
manifest by the very beginning of his poem—an invocation to
the Muses woven of unexceptionable <span lang="la"><i>gradus</i></span>-tags,
and deftly dovetailed into a dedication to the luckless
Dauphin Francis, who had then taken his father’s place as Charles
the Fifth’s prisoner at Madrid, and to whose captivity the poem
is modestly offered as a solace or pastime. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Analysis of the piece.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> These invocations
accomplished <span lang="la"><i>more majorum</i></span>, Vida proceeds to occupy his First
Book with a sort of general clearing of the ground. He is ready
to teach the secret of all kinds of poetry; but the poet must
very carefully inquire what are the kinds to which he himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>is best adapted and best inclined. Commissioned work is
dubious, unless under a king’s command. But there is more
than this: the poetic child must be carefully nursed in the
arts suitable to his great calling. He must be as carefully
guarded from the taint of vulgar and incorrect speech; and
must be regularly initiated into Poetry—Latin first, especially
Virgil, and then Greek, especially Homer. A short historical
sketch of poetry follows; but it, like everything else, is brought
round to the deification of the Mantuan. Hence Vida (who
must be pronounced rather long in weighing anchor) diverges
to a good-natured intercession with parents and teachers not to
have the boys whipped too much, telling a moving legend of an
extremely pretty<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c019'><sup>[37]</sup></a> boy who was actually whipped to death, or
at least died of fear. Emulation, however, is quite a good
stimulus; and by degrees work will be loved for itself. But
original poetical production must not be attempted too young;
there must be time for play; the rudiments of metre and so
forth must be thoroughly learnt; and, above all, <span lang="la"><i>non omnes
omnia</i></span> must be constantly kept in mind. It is better to begin
with pastorals and minor subjects; solitude and country life are
very desirable circumstances. And so Book I. closes with a
fresh invocation of the spirit of poetry and a fresh celebration
of its power.</p>

<p class='c000'>After this rather ample prelude the author somewhat unreasonably
(seeing that the delay has been his own doing), but
in coachmanlike fashion, says <span lang="la"><i>Pergite! Pierides</i></span>, and proposes
to unfold the whole of Helicon to coming ages. The first disclosure
is scarcely novel. You must invoke Jove and the
Muses; nor will one Invocation do. When in doubt always
invoke.<a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c019'><sup>[38]</sup></a> Next you should, without holding out bombastic
promises, allure your reader by a modest but sufficient
description of the subject of your poem. So far the method
of turning the practice of the ancients into a principle is
impartially adjusted to Homer and Virgil alike; but after a
few score verses the partisan appears. The beginnings of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span><cite>Iliad</cite> and the <cite>Odyssey</cite>, the plunging into the midst of things
with the wrath of Achilles, and the sojourn with Calypso,
instead of the rape of Helen (why not of Hesione?) or the
launching from Troy, are duly praised. But the elaborate
Homeric descriptions—as that of the car—are boggled at; the
introduction of Thersites shocks Vida (Drances seems a far
nobler figure), and the pettiness of the subjects of some of
the Homeric similes would never suit the magniloquence of
the Latian Muse.<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c019'><sup>[39]</sup></a> In Virgil, on the other hand, he can see no
fault; even the demand of Venus for arms to clothe her bastard
son, which had given qualms to admirers of old, does not disturb
Vida at all; and his poem seems to be slipping by degrees into a
mere <span lang="fr"><i>précis</i></span> of the <cite>Æneid</cite>, that each trait actually found in Virgil
may be registered as a pattern to poets generally. He wrenches
himself free for a moment to inculcate the following of nature;
but presently lapses into an elaborate demonstration of the
beautiful way in which the Mantuan <em>does</em> follow nature. In
short, though now and then to “save his face” an illustration is
drawn <span lang="la"><i>honoris causa</i></span> from Homer, this Second Book on the
<span lang="fr"><i>ordonnance</i></span> of the poem is, till it ceases with a panegyric of Leo
X., little more than a descant <cite>On the Imitation of Virgil</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>It cannot be said that the Third Book offers much difference
in this respect—though the idolatry of Virgil is in parts
a little more disguised. It is, again <span lang="la"><i>more majorum</i></span>, devoted to
Diction, and, the Muses having been invited to cross the stage
once more, our Mentor first reprobates Obscurity. But though
you must not be obscure, you may and should be Figurative,
and not a few of the best known of our ancient acquaintances
the Figures—Metaphor, Hyperbole, Apostrophe, and so forth—are
introduced and commended, or sometimes discommended.
It is extremely noteworthy that the warnings-off include one
far from ugly conceit—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>

      <div class='line'><span lang="la">“Aut crines Magnæ Genetricis gramina dicat.”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>This, of course, is quite in accordance with the horror of a
daring metaphor—of one which runs the risk of seeming
“frigid”—which we find prevailing from Aristotle to Longinus,
and even in both these great men. To us, most assuredly, the
likening of the grass to the tresses of Mother Earth is not in the
least absurd, but a very beautiful and poetical phrase, awaking,
and adjusting itself aptly to, a train of equally poetical suggestion.
But before very long the advice as to the choice of language
takes the plain and simple form, “Strip the Ancients!”
The poet is bidden to fit</p>

<p class='c008'>to himself; he is to gird himself up to the “theft,” and drive
the spoil on every occasion. He who trusts to his own wit and
invention is unhesitatingly condemned and pitied. If you want
to live, to have your works escape decay, you must “steal.”
Vida repeats the very word over and over again, and without
the slightest bashfulness or compunction. He is, however, good
enough to admit that, if a new word is absolutely wanted to
express something not in the ancients, it may be invented or
borrowed—say from Greek—as the older Latins had themselves
done. When one word is difficult to find or awkward
if found, you must employ Periphrasis. Compounds are permitted
to a certain extent (the weakness of Latin and its
brood in this respect is well known), but never to a greater
than that of two words. <span lang="la"><em>Perterricrepas</em></span> is stigmatised by
innuendo, though the word itself is Lucretian, and though
there is absolutely no principle in the restriction. You are
to tone down ill-sounding proper names, as Sicharbas into
Sichæus. But in all cases your words are to be entirely subservient
to the sense, though they may and should be suited
to it—a doctrine which lends itself of course to extensive Virgilian
illustration. And so the poem concludes with a peroration
of some length, drawing ever and ever closer to, and at
last ending in, the laudation of the unrivalled Maro.</p>

<p class='c000'>Had it not been for the astonishing accuracy with which, as
has been said, Vida actually anticipated the dominant critical
taste of something like three hundred years, and the creative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>taste of about half that period, not many more lines than we
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Essential poverty of its theory.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
have given pages might have been devoted to him.
That the poem as a composition is a sufficiently
elegant piece of patchwork may of course be freely
granted; and it deserves perhaps less grudging praise for the
extreme fidelity and ingenuity with which it illustrates its own
doctrines. But those doctrines themselves are, whether we look
at them in gross or in detail, some of the poorest and most beggarly
things to be found in the whole range of criticism. That the
prescriptions are practically limited to those necessary for turning
out the epic or “heroic” poem does not so much matter—though
it is not entirely without significance. Vida’s idea of
poetry is simply and literally shoddy.<a id='r40'></a><a href='#f40' class='c019'><sup>[40]</sup></a> That fabric—the fact is
perhaps not invariably known to those who use the word—differs
from others, not as pinchbeck differs from gold, or
cotton from silk, but in being exclusively composed of already
manufactured and worn textures which are torn up and passed
afresh through mill and loom. And this is the process—and
practically the sole process—which Vida enjoins on the poet,
going so far as to pronounce anathema on any one who dares to
pursue any other.</p>

<p class='c000'>When it is examined in detail the proceeding may excite even
more astonishment, which will be wisely directed not more to
<span class='sni side12'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Historical and symptomatic significance.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the original conception of it than to the extent to
which, from what followed, it seems to have hit certain
peculiarities in the æsthetic sense of mankind
as regards poetry. We may easily go wrong by
devoting too much attention to the fact of Vida’s individual
selection of the poet to whom all other poets are bound <span lang="la"><i>jurare
in verba</i></span>. It is certain that, from his own day to this, Virgil
has appealed to many tastes—and to some of the greatest—secure
of his result of being pronounced <span lang="la"><i>altissimo poeta</i></span>. Those
who like him least cannot but admit that Dante and Tennyson
among poets, that Quintilian and Scaliger—nay, that even
Boileau—among critics, are not precisely negligible quantities.
But the real subject—not merely of astonishment but of reasonable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>and deliberate determination to adopt a position of “No
Surrender” in the denial of Vida’s position—is this selection
of <em>any</em> poet, no matter who it may be, as not only a positive
pattern of all poetic excellence, but a negative <span lang="la"><i>index expurgatorius</i></span>
of all poetic delinquency. Not Homer, not Dante, not
Shakespeare himself, can be allowed the first position; and the
main principle and axiom of all sound Criticism is, that not
merely no actual poet, but no possible one, can be allowed the
second. This kind of poetical predestination—this fixing of a
hard-and-fast type, within which lies all salvation and without
which lies none—is utter blasphemy against the poetical spirit.
Not only will simple imitation of the means whereby one poet
has achieved poetry not suffice to enable another to achieve it,
but this suggestion is by far the least dangerous part of the
doctrine. It will probably lead to the composition of much bad
poetry, but it will not necessarily cause the abortion, or the
mistaking when born, of any that is good. The damnatory
clauses of the creed must have, and did have, this fatal effect.</p>

<p class='c000'>Vida and those who followed him excused themselves, were
accepted by their disciples, and have recently been eulogised by
our newest Neo-Classics, as following Nature and
Reason. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The alleged appeal to Reason and Nature.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> That they said—perhaps that they thought—they
followed both is unquestionable.<a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c019'><sup>[41]</sup></a> But as a
matter of fact their Law of Nature—like the Articles
of War in Marryat’s novel—was a dead letter, owing to the proviso,
from the first more or less clearly hinted at and latterly
avowed, that all of Nature that was worth imitating had already
been imitated by the ancients. As for the appeal to Reason, it
is a mere juggle with words; and it is astonishing that at this
time of day any one should be deluded by it. What Reason prescribes
Invocations to the Muses? What Reason insists upon beginning
at the middle instead of at the beginning? What Reason
is there in the preference of the pale <span lang="fr"><i>académie</i></span> of Drances to the
Rembrandt sketch of the demagogue whom Ulysses cudgelled?
of the shield of Æneas to the car of Achilles? of Sichæus to
Sicharbas? What has Reason to say (more than she has to say
against poetic transports altogether) against the exquisite and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>endlessly suggestive metaphor of “the tresses of the Mighty
Mother” for the grass, with its wave, and its light, and its
shadow, and the outline of the everlasting hills and vales as of
the sleeping body beneath it? In all these cases, and in a
hundred others, we may boldly answer “None and Nothing!”
The true Reason—the Mind of the World—has not a word to
say against any of these forbidden things, or in favour of any of
those preferred ones.</p>

<p class='c000'>But there is, let it be freely enough granted, a false Reason
which has, no doubt, very much to say against the one and in
favour of the other. The warped and stunted common-sense,
the pedestrian and prosaic matter-of-factness, which is no doubt
natural enough in a certain way to mankind, had made little
appearance during the Middle Ages. These Ages may be called,
if any one chooses, childish, they may be still more justly called
fantastic; but they were never prosaic. It might be said of
their Time-Spirit as of the albatross, that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr">“Ses ailes de géant l’empêchent de marcher.”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>But there was no doubt about the wings. With the Renaissance,
prose, in the good sense no doubt as well as in the bad, returned;
and as if to revenge itself for the universal employment of
poetry during the Middle Ages themselves, it proceeded to
lay hands even upon the poet. He might “transport”; with
Longinus before them (if Vida had him not, his followers had),
they could not very well deny this. But his methods of transporting
must be previously submitted to a kind of inspectorship;
and anything dangerous or unusual was strictly forbidden.
His bolt was not to be “shot too soon nor beyond the moon”:
he was most particularly <em>not</em> to be “of imagination all compact.”
On the contrary, his imagination was to be alloyed with doses
of the commonest common-sense. He might not even imp his
wings save with registered feathers, and these feathers were
to be neither too long nor too gay.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such are the principles that we find in Vida, and such their
inevitable result. Only let us once more repeat, not merely that
he may well, in the admirable words of Lord Foppington, “be
proud to belong to so prevailing a party” as the Neo-Classics of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>the following three centuries, but that he actually led and almost
made that party himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>A considerable time—more than a quarter of a century—had
elapsed between Politian and Vida; but from the appearance of
the latter’s book to the end of the century not more than three
years on the average<a id='r42'></a><a href='#f42' class='c019'><sup>[42]</sup></a> passed without the appearance of a critical
treatise of some importance. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The main stream started.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Every now and then a short lull
would occur; but this was always made up by a greater crowd
of writers after the interval. Such “rallies” of criticism
(which occurred particularly during the fourth
decade<a id='r43'></a><a href='#f43' class='c019'><sup>[43]</sup></a> of the century, about its very centre,<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c019'><sup>[44]</sup></a> throughout
the seventh,<a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c019'><sup>[45]</sup></a> eighth,<a id='r46'></a><a href='#f46' class='c019'><sup>[46]</sup></a> and ninth<a id='r47'></a><a href='#f47' class='c019'><sup>[47]</sup></a> decades, and just at the
end<a id='r48'></a><a href='#f48' class='c019'><sup>[48]</sup></a>) were no doubt to some extent determined by the academic
habits of the Italians, and the readiness with which members of the
same academy, or different academies, took up the cudgels against
each other. The individual exercises took various forms. A
very large part of the work consists of commentaries on Aristotle’s
<cite>Poetics</cite>; another, closely connected, of set “Arts Poetic,”
more ostensibly original; some deal with vulgar and some with
“regular” poetry, while the concrete and comparative method
is by no means neglected, though the abstract and theoretic is
on the whole preferred. To attempt classification by kind
would be a sacrifice of real to apparent method; and to trace the
development of the same ideas in different writers would lead to
inextricable confusion and criss-cross reference. We shall probably
find it best to follow the rule which has been observed with
rare exceptions throughout this History—that of giving the gist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>of particular books and the opinions of particular authors together,
and leaving bird’s-eye views to the Interchapters.</p>

<p class='c000'>Only two years after the appearance of Vida’s poem appeared
the next critical Italian book of importance, the first
instalment of Trissino’s <span lang="it"><cite>Poetica</cite></span>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Trissino.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The first instalment—for
a singular interval took place between the beginning
and the completion of this work. The first four parts
were, as has just been said, published in 1529, when the main
stream of Italian criticism had hardly begun to flow; the two
last not till 1563, two years after the publication of Scaliger’s
great work, and after a full generation (in the ordinary count)
of active discussion of the matters.<a id='r49'></a><a href='#f49' class='c019'><sup>[49]</sup></a> Such conditions cannot
fail to affect the homogeneity of a book. But still Trissino put
it forth as one book in different parts, not, as he might very
well have done, and as others actually did, as two books; and
we are therefore entitled, and indeed bound, with the caution
just given, to treat it as a whole. The handsome quartos,<a id='r50'></a><a href='#f50' class='c019'><sup>[50]</sup></a> well
printed and beautifully frontispieced and vignetted, of the
standard edition of Trissino’s <span lang="it"><cite>Opere</cite></span>, are perhaps, taking them
together, rather an ornament to the shelf than a plentiful
provision of furniture for the mind. The disadvantages of
<span lang="it"><i>versi sciolti</i></span> have not often been shown more conspicuously than
in the <span lang="it"><cite>Italia Liberata</cite></span>, and the <span lang="it"><cite>Sofonisba</cite></span> has little but its earliness
and regularity to plead as a set-off to the general shortcomings
of the modern classical Drama. The better repute of
Italian comedy would hardly have arisen from such pieces as
<span lang="it"><cite>I Simillimi</cite></span>; and the <span lang="it"><cite>Rime</cite></span> are most ordinary things. In our
own division he is of some historical account; for it is impossible
not to be grateful to the first publisher of the <span lang="la"><cite>De Vulgari
Eloquio</cite></span>, and that praise of earliness, which he has earned in
more than one respect, must be extended to the first four parts
of the <span lang="it"><cite>Poetica</cite></span>. He boasts justly enough that nobody, save
Dante and Antonio da Tempo, was before him, and that both of
these had written in Latin.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Trissino does not, in his first instalment, busy himself with
those abstract discussions which were soon to furnish the staple of
Italian criticism. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Division of his</i> Poetic.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He adopts Aristotle’s “Imitation”
briefly without cavil or qualification; and then
passes, in his First Part or “Division,” to the question
of choosing your language, in which he generally follows
Dante, but with an adaptation to the time. It is not with
him a question of <em>making</em> an “Illustrious Vulgar Tongue,” an
“Italian,” but of calling by that name one already adopted.
In his further remarks on Diction he sometimes borrows, and
often expands or supplements, the very words of Dante at first,
and then passes to elaborate discussion, with examples, of the
qualities of speech—Clearness, Grandeur, Beauty, Swiftness.
Next he deals with what he calls the <em>costume</em>—character,
<em>ethos</em>, suiting of style to person—with truth, artifice, and what
he calls the “fashions”—that is to say, the alterations of
quantity, &#38;c., by dwelling, slurring, syncope, and the like. The
arrangement of this First Division is not very logical; but, as
we have seen, cross-division has been the curse of rhetorical-formal
discussion of the kind from a very early period to the
present day. The Second Division deals with pure prosody,
the division of feet, shortening (<span lang="it"><i>rimozione</i></span>), as in <span lang="it"><i>ciel</i></span> for <span lang="it"><i>cielo</i></span>,
elision, cæsura, &#38;c.; the Third with arrangement of verses and
stanzas; the Fourth with the complete forms of Sonnet, Ballata,
and Canzone, the sub-varieties of which were detailed with great
care and plentiful examples.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here what might more properly be called the First Part,
consisting of these four divisions, ends; the long subsequent
Second Part (made up of the Fifth and Sixth Divisions) has a
separate Preface-dedication referring to the gap. These parts
are not, like the others, divided into sections with headings;
and, doubtless on the pattern if not of any one particular
treatise, of the spirit of many which had gone between, they
deal with general questions. The Imitation theory is handled
at some length, and with citation of Plato as well as of Aristotle;
the kinds of poetry are treated on a more general standard,
and not with mere reference to the rules of constructing each.
The larger part of the Fifth Division is given entirely to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>Tragedy: the Sixth begins with that Heroic Poem which
was so much on the mind of the country and the century.
But it ends chiefly on Figures—the formal heart of Trissino,
long-travelled as it has been, fondly turning to its old loves
at the last.</p>

<p class='c000'>The contents of the treatise or treatises, especially if we take
them with Trissino’s attempts to introduce the Greek Omega
and the Greek Epsilon into Italian spelling, his
grammatical “Doubts,” and his later “Introduction
to Grammar,” his dialogue <span lang="it"><cite>Il Castellano</cite></span>, and so
forth,<a id='r51'></a><a href='#f51' class='c019'><sup>[51]</sup></a> will show his standpoint with sufficient clearness. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His critical value.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It is
almost purely formal in the minor, not to say the minim,
kinds of form. He is indeed credited by some with a position
of importance, in the history of the Unities. He is, they say,
the first to refer to the observance of the Unity of Time as a distinction
from “ignorant poets,”<a id='r52'></a><a href='#f52' class='c019'><sup>[52]</sup></a> giving therewith a disparaging
glance at mediæval drama.<a id='r53'></a><a href='#f53' class='c019'><sup>[53]</sup></a> But this overlooks the fact that
he is simply repeating what Aristotle says, with an addition
much more likely<a id='r54'></a><a href='#f54' class='c019'><sup>[54]</sup></a> to refer to non-Humanist contemporaries
than to the almost forgotten “mystery.” His theory of the
Heroic Poem, like his practice in the <span lang="it"><cite>Italia Liberata</cite></span>, is slavishly
Aristotelian. The chief evidence of real development
that I can find is in his treatment of Comedy, where the extremely
rapid and contemptuous dismissal of the Master called
imperatively for some supplement, considering the popularity
of the kind in the writer’s own time and country. Possibly
reinforcing Aristotle here with Cicero, and certainly using the
famous <span lang="la"><i>Suave mari magno</i></span> of Lucretius, he succeeds in putting
together a theory of the ludicrous to which, or to some subsequent
developments of it in Italy, Hobbes’s “passion of sudden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>glory” has been<a id='r55'></a><a href='#f55' class='c019'><sup>[55]</sup></a> not unjustly traced. The “sudden” seems
indeed to be directly due to Maggi, a critic who will be presently
mentioned with other commentators on the <cite>Poetics</cite>. And
Maggi had published long before Trissino’s later Divisions
appeared, though, it may be, not before they were written.<a id='r56'></a><a href='#f56' class='c019'><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The growth during the interval had been of three kinds,
sometimes blended, sometimes kept apart. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Editors, &#38;c., of the</i> Poetics.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The first kind consisted
of translations, editions, and commentaries of
and on the <cite>Poetics</cite>; the second, of abstract discussions
of Poetry; the third, of more or less formal
“Arts” not very different from Trissino’s own. The first class
produced later, in the work of Castelvetro, a contribution of
almost the first importance to the History and to the Art of
Criticism; and it could not but exercise a powerful influence.
It belongs, however, in all but its most prominent examples
(such as that just referred to, which will be fully discussed in
the next chapter), rather to monographers on Aristotle than to
general historians of Criticism, inasmuch as it is mainly parasitic.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Pazzi.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Before any book of original critical importance later
than Trissino’s had been issued, in 1536,<a id='r57'></a><a href='#f57' class='c019'><sup>[57]</sup></a> Alessandro de’ Pazzi
published a Latin translation of the <cite>Poetics</cite>, which
for some time held the position of standard, and
a dozen years later came three important works on the book—Robortello’s
edition of 1548, Segni’s Italian translation of 1549,
and Maggi’s edition of 1550—all showing the attention and
interest which the subject was exciting, while, still before the
later “Divisions” of Trissino appeared, Vettori in 1560 added his
edition, of greater importance than any earlier one. Long before
this the book had become a regular subject of lectures. Of
these writers Robortello, and still more Vettori (“Victorius”),
were of the greatest service to the text; Maggi, who was assisted
by Lombardi, to the discussion of the matter.<a id='r58'></a><a href='#f58' class='c019'><sup>[58]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>In the critical handling of these editors and commentators
we find, as we should expect, much of the old rhetorical trifling.
<span class='sni side12'><span class='hidev'>|</span><em>Robortello</em>, <em>Segni</em>, <em>Maggi</em>, <em>Vettori</em>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
For all their scorn, expressed or implied, of the Middle Ages,
they repeat the distinctions of <span lang="la"><i>poetica</i></span>, <span lang="la"><i>poesis</i></span>, <span lang="la"><i>poeta</i></span>, and <span lang="la"><i>poema</i></span><a id='r59'></a><a href='#f59' class='c019'><sup>[59]</sup></a>
as docilely as Martianus, or a student of Martianus, could have
done a thousand or five hundred years before, and they hand it
on too as a sort of charmed catchword to Scaliger<a id='r60'></a><a href='#f60' class='c019'><sup>[60]</sup></a> and Jonson.<a id='r61'></a><a href='#f61' class='c019'><sup>[61]</sup></a>
But brought face to face as they are with the always weighty,
though by no means always transparently clear, doctrines of
Aristotle, and self-charged with the duty of explaining and
commenting them, they cannot, if they would, escape the necessity
of grappling with the more abstract and less merely technological
questions. Robortello,<a id='r62'></a><a href='#f62' class='c019'><sup>[62]</sup></a> like Maggi, though less
elaborately, has a theory of the ludicrous. Both, and
others, necessarily grapple with that <em>crux</em> of the
<em>katharsis</em> which has not yet ceased to be crucial.
Both, with Segni, discuss the Unity of Time and differ about it;
though none of the three has yet discovered (as indeed it is not
discoverable in Aristotle or Aristotle’s literary documents) the yet
more malignant Unity of Place. Vettori would extend the cramp
in time (not of course with the twenty-four hours’ limit) from
tragedy to epic. Most of them have arrived at that besotment
as to “verisimilitude” which is responsible for the worst parts
of the Neo-Classic theory, and which, in the pleasant irony common
to all entanglements with Duessas of the kind, makes the
unfortunate lovers guilty of the wildest excesses of artificial
improbability. And in all, whether they project their reflections
on their text into more general forms or not, we can see the
gradual crystallising of a theory of poetry, heroic, or dramatic,
or general.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor was such theory left without direct and independent
exposition during the period which we are considering. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Theorists: Daniello.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The
first author of one is generally taken to be Daniello,
whose <span lang="it"><cite>Poetica</cite></span> appeared in 1536; and I have not
discovered any earlier claimant. I do not quite understand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>how Mr Spingarn has arrived at the conclusion that “in Daniello’s
theory of tragedy there is no single Aristotelian element,”
especially as he himself elsewhere acknowledges the close—almost
verbal—adherence of this early writer to the Stagirite.
But it is probably true that Daniello was thinking more of the
Platonic objections and of following out the Boccaccian defence,
than of merely treading in the footprints of Aristotle. He is
the first, since Boccaccio himself, to undertake that generous, if
rather wide and vague as well as superfluous, “defence of poesy”
which many Italians repeated after him, and which was repeated
after them by our Elizabethans, notably by Sir Philip Sidney.</p>

<p class='c000'>As his little book is somewhat rare, and as it has such good
claims to be among the very earliest vernacular disputations of
a general character on poetry in Italy, if not also in Europe,
it may be well to give some account of it. My copy has no
title-page, but dates itself by a colophon on the <span lang="la"><i>recto</i></span> of the
errata-leaf at the end, with a veto-privilege, by concession of
the Pope, the seignory of Venice, and <em>all</em> the other princes and
lords of Italy, advertised by Giovan Antonio di Nicolini da
Sabio, Venice, 1536. It fills 136 small pages of italic type, and
is in dialogue form, rather rhetorically but not inelegantly
written, and dedicated by Bernardo Daniello of Lucca to
Andrea Cornelio, Bishop-Elect of Brescia. Daniello does refer
to Aristotle, and borrows (not perhaps quite intelligently) from
him; but his chief sources are the Latins, and he sets or resets,
with no small interest for us, that note of apology for the
Poets against Plato which was to dominate Italian criticism,
and after exercising some, but less, effect on French, to be
strenuously echoed in England. There are some rather striking
things in Daniello. He is sound enough on the mission of the
poet as being to delight (though he is to teach too) and also to
persuade—the ancient union of Poetics and limited Rhetoric
evidently working in him. On the relations of poetry and
philosophy he might be echoing Maximus Tyrius and Boccaccio,
and very likely is thinking of the latter. But he strikes a certain
cold into us by remarking that Dante (whom he nevertheless
admires very much) was perhaps greater and more perfect as a
philosopher than as a poet; and it does not seem likely that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>was aware of the far-reaching import of his own words when he
lays it down (p. 26) that Invention, Disposition, and Elocution
being the three important things, the poet is not, as some think,
limited to any special matter. If he had meant this, of course
he would have come to one of those <em>arcana</em> of criticism which are
even yet revealed, as matter of serene conviction, to very few
critics. But he pretty certainly did not fully understand his
own assertion; and indeed slurs it off immediately afterwards.
After taking some examples from Dante and more from
Petrarch, Daniello adopts (again prophetically) the doctrine
that the Poet must practically know all arts and sciences, in
order that he may properly deal with his universal subject.
He is specially to study what is called in Latin <span lang="la"><em>Decorum</em></span> and in
Italian <span lang="la"><em>Convenevolezza</em></span>. Tragedy and Comedy are to be rigidly
distinguished. And so this curious First Blast of the Trumpet
of sixteenth-century vernacular criticism is emphatic against
the confusion which was to bring about the mightiest glories of
sixteenth-century literature. A large part of the small treatise
is taken up with examples, in the old rhetorical manner of
qualities, “colours,” figures, &#38;c. The whole of the latter part of
the First Book consists of these, as does almost the whole of the
Second, with an extension into verbal criticism of the passages
cited as illustrating kinds, technical terms, and the like. Indeed
the general considerations are chiefly to be found in the
first forty or fifty pages; and it is really remarkable how much
there is in this short space which practically anticipates in
summary the ideas of most of the much more voluminous
writers who follow.<a id='r63'></a><a href='#f63' class='c019'><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Fracastoro, physician, logician, and not ungraceful poet of the
graceless subject of <cite>Syphilis</cite>, deals with both Plato
and Aristotle in his dialogue <cite>Naugerius</cite>, and discourses
deeply on the doctrine of Imitation, the Theory of Beauty, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Aristotelian conception of the poet as more universal and philosophical
than the historian, and the Platonic objection to the intervals
between poetry and truth. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Fracastoro.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> This dialogue,<a id='r64'></a><a href='#f64' class='c019'><sup>[64]</sup></a> however (the
full title is <span lang="la"><cite>Naugerius sive de Poetica</cite></span>, its chief interlocutor being
Andrea Navagero, the best follower of Catullus in Renaissance
Latin<a id='r65'></a><a href='#f65' class='c019'><sup>[65]</sup></a>), tells a certain tale by its coupling with another, <span lang="la"><cite>Turrius
sive de Intellectione</cite></span>. It is wholly philosophical in intent and
drift: it is perhaps the very “farthest”—comparatively early
(1555) as is its date—of those Italian excursions, in the direction
of making Criticism an almost wholly abstract and <span lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span>
subject, which balance the unblushing “Convey—do nothing but
convey,” of Vida and his followers. One of its very earliest
axioms (p. 324 <i>ed. cit. infra</i>) is that “<span lang="la">qui recte dicere de hac re
velit, prius sciat necesse est, quænam poetæ natura est, quidque
ipsa poetica, tum et quis philosophi genius,</span>” &#38;c. It must be
admitted that Fracastoro is among the very ablest and most
thoroughgoing explorers of these altitudes. No one has more
clearly grasped, or put more forcibly, than he has that compromise
between Plato and Aristotle which has been and will be
mentioned so often as characteristic of the Italian thinkers in this
kind. Indeed, the fifty pages of his Dialogue are almost a <span lang="la"><i>locus
classicus</i></span> for the first drawing up of the creed which converted
Sidney, and to which Milton, indocile to creeds as he was, gave
scarcely grudging allegiance. It is full, too, of interest in
deliverances on minor points—the difference between the orator
and the rhetor (p. 343), the shaping of a particular kind of
“orator” into a poet, his universality and his usefulness, the
limits of his permitted fiction and the character of his charm.
But Fracastoro is wholly in these generals: it is much if he
permits himself a rare illustration from an actual poet.</p>

<p class='c000'>And always in these writers we find the old deviations, the
old red herrings drawn across the scent. Fracastoro himself,
reasonable as he is in many ways, falls into the foolish old fallacy
that a good poet must be a good man, and the less obviously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>ridiculous but still mischievous demand from him of the all-accomplished
acquirements once asked of the rhetorician.</p>

<p class='c000'>Putting aside, for the moment, such rather later and much
more important works as the <span lang="it"><cite>Discorsi</cite></span> of Giraldi Cinthio, the <span lang="la"><cite>De
Poetis Nostrorum Temporum</cite></span> of his half-namesake
Lilius Giraldus, and the two capital treatises of Minturno,
one of which appeared after Trissino’s book,
we may give a few words to two Italian tractates,
the <span lang="it"><cite>Versi e Regole della Nuova Poesia Toscana</cite></span>of Claudio Tolomei
(1539) and Muzio’s or Mutio’s Italian verse <span lang="it"><cite>Arte Poetica</cite></span>, which
was published with some other work in 1551.<a id='r66'></a><a href='#f66' class='c019'><sup>[66]</sup></a> <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Formalists: Mutio. Tolomei and classical metres.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The last is
noteworthy as an early example of the vernacular critical poem—a
kind suggested by Horace, and illustrated later by Boileau and
Pope, but certainly more honoured by its practitioners than in
itself. Yet it would not be just to deny Mutio a high if rather
vague conception of poetry, and, in particular, a most salutary
conviction that the poet must <em>dis</em>realise his subjects. Tolomei’s
book, on the other hand, challenges attention as probably the
beginning of that pestilent heresy of “classical metres” which,
arising in Italy, and tainting France but slightly (as was
natural considering the almost unquantified character of the
modern French language), fastened with virulence upon England,
affected some of our best wits, and was within measurable
distance of doing serious harm. The plague was so much at its
worst with us that the chapter on Elizabethan Criticism will be
the proper place for its discussion. But though Ascham himself
thought it no plague at all, it was certainly one of the
very worst of these “Italianations” to which he objected so
violently; and Tolomei was its first prophet in the country of its
origin.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not a few names, some famous in European literature for
other performances of their bearers, some almost unknown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>except to the student of this subject, fall into one or other of
these classes, or, as very commonly happens, qualify
in a undecided manner for two, or for all. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Others: Tomitano, Lionardi, B. Tasso, Capriano.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> As early
as 1545 Tomitano<a id='r67'></a><a href='#f67' class='c019'><sup>[67]</sup></a> had dwelt on the above-mentioned
fallacy of the necessary learning of poets: Lionardi,<a id='r68'></a><a href='#f68' class='c019'><sup>[68]</sup></a>
nine years later, in a pair of Dialogues expressly devoted to
<i>Poetic Invention</i>, extended this in the widest and wildest manner,
so that the poet becomes a perfect good-man-of-the-Stoics—an
all-round and impeccable Grandison-Aristotle. The same idea
and others were emitted by Bernardo Tasso, good father of a
great son, who not only practised poetry to the vast extent of
the <span lang="it"><cite>Amadigi</cite></span>, but discussed it in a formal <span lang="it"><cite>Ragionamento</cite></span> of the
subject.<a id='r69'></a><a href='#f69' class='c019'><sup>[69]</sup></a> Later, Capriano<a id='r70'></a><a href='#f70' class='c019'><sup>[70]</sup></a> gave the more elaborate exaltation
of poetry as a sort of Art of Arts, combining and subduing
to its own purpose all forms of Imitation, and following
up Vida’s superfine objections to Homer as trivial and undignified,
and his rapturous exaltation of the “decency” of
Virgil. This book, very short, is also rather important—more
so than might be judged from some accounts of it.
It is neither paged, nor numbered in folio, but does not
extend beyond signature F ii. of a small quarto, with a brief
appendix of Italian verse. There are eight chapters—the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>discussing what things are imitable and what imitation is; the
second vindicating for poetry the portion of supreme imitative
art; the third dividing it into “natural” and “moral”; the
fourth arguing that Epic or Heroic (not, as Aristotle thinks,
drama) is the highest kind of “moral” poetry; the fifth containing,
among other things, an interesting revolt against
Greek; the sixth discoursing on number and sound; the seventh
exalting the good poem above everything; and the eighth
rapidly discussing the origin, rank, necessity, parts, force, end,
&#38;c., of Poetry. Capriano does not give himself much room, and
fails, like most of these critics, in the all-important connection
of his theories with actual work; but he must have been a man
of no common independence and force of thought.<a id='r71'></a><a href='#f71' class='c019'><sup>[71]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>More important than these to us, though less technically
critical, and therefore in some cases commending themselves
less to students of the subject from some points of
view, are some poets and men of letters of the earlier
and middle parts of the century who have touched critical subjects.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Il Lasca.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> I should myself regard the Prologues<a id='r72'></a><a href='#f72' class='c019'><sup>[72]</sup></a> of Grazzini (“Il
Lasca”)—in which he repeatedly and unweariedly protests
against the practice of moulding Italian comedy upon Plautus
and Terence, regardless of the utter change in manners, and so
forth—as worth shelves full of “in-the-air” treatises. For this
application of the <span lang="la"><i>speculum vitæ</i></span><a id='r73'></a><a href='#f73' class='c019'><sup>[73]</sup></a> notion, the idea of <cite>The Muses’
Looking-glass</cite>, which was obtained from Cicero through Donatus,
was the salvation of the time, keeping Comedy at least free
from the fossilising influences of the false Imitation. Although
the unwary might reasonably take the author of the famous
caution not to read St Paul for fear of spoiling style (there are
at least half-a-dozen of the greatest pieces of style in the world
to be found in the two <cite>Epistles to the Corinthians</cite> alone) as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>either a silly practitioner of undergraduate paradox or a serious
dolt, yet the <span lang="it"><cite>Della Volgar Lingua</cite></span> of Bembo<a id='r74'></a><a href='#f74' class='c019'><sup>[74]</sup></a> is by no
possibility to be neglected in taking account of the
critical attitude of Italy at the time. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Bembo.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It is of course too purist
and “precious”; it “sticks in the letter” to a perilous extent;
but there is real appreciation in it of what the writer can
appreciate, and among the things that he can appreciate are
good and great things. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Caro.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Annibale Caro has (and deserves) a
bad name, not merely for the unfair manner in
which he carried on his controversy with Castelvetro
(see next chapter), but for the tedious logomachy of the
controversy itself, which on his side, besides filling a regular
<span lang="it"><cite>Apologia</cite></span> and other pieces, overflows constantly into his letters.<a id='r75'></a><a href='#f75' class='c019'><sup>[75]</sup></a>
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Varchi.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But this very controversy testifies to the zest and the undoubted
sincerity with which literary matters were dealt with by the
Italians, and it served further as a starting-point for the elaborate
<span lang="it"><cite>Ercolano</cite></span><a id='r76'></a><a href='#f76' class='c019'><sup>[76]</sup></a> of Varchi, who in divers lectures, &#38;c.,
also dealt with the more abstract questions of the
nature of poetry, the status of the poet, and the like. In short,
the documents on the subject have already reached the condition
referred to by the warning given in the introductory
chapter to the first volume of this book, that while in that
volume we had to search for and discuss every scrap bearing on
the subject, here large classes of document would have to be
treated by summary and representation only.</p>

<p class='c000'>Moreover, great as are the volume and the intensity of Italian
attention to criticism in the years between 1535 and 1560, the
Devil’s Advocate may, without mere cavilling, cast disparagement
upon most of its expressions. The dealings of the scholars with
the subject are no doubt to a certain extent accidental or obligatory;
they might have bestowed, and in fact actually did
bestow,<a id='r77'></a><a href='#f77' class='c019'><sup>[77]</sup></a> at least equal pains on texts not directly, or not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>at all, concerning criticism. The work of Tolomei is merely
an example of those Puckish tricks which something sometimes
plays on the human intellect; that of Muzio a dilettante exercise
mainly. The treatises of the others from Daniello to Varchi
hover between abstract discussion, which sometimes approaches
twaddle, dilettante trifling which makes the same approach on
another side, and an estimable, but for literature at large comparatively
unimportant, guerilla about the virtues and qualities,
the vices and defects, of the Italian language—a language which
had already seen its very best days, and was settling down to
days very far from its best. The three authors to whom we
shall now come, and who will occupy us to the end of this
chapter, escape, in one way or another, the brunt of all these
grudgements. Minturno supplies us with the most wide-ranging
and systematic handlings of poetry in its general, and of
“regular” and “vulgar” poetry in their particular, aspects that
had yet been produced, Giraldi Cinthio with some of the most
original critical essays, Lilius Giraldus with a survey of the
poetical, and to some extent the literary, state of Europe in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>time, for the like of which we may look in vain before and not
too successfully since.</p>

<p class='c000'>Antonio Sebastiano, called Minturno (which is stated—I
know not with what correctness—in a MS. note in my copy of
the <span lang="la"><cite>Arte Poetica</cite></span> to be merely an “academic”
surname), is a good example of that combination
of scholastic thoroughness and diligence with wider range of
study which honourably distinguishes the sixteenth and early
seventeenth centuries, but which, save in rare instances, went
out in the later years of the last-named age, and has too seldom
been recovered since. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Minturno.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In 1559 he produced a <span lang="la"><cite>De Poeta</cite></span> and in
1563 an <span lang="la"><cite>Arte Poetica</cite></span>, one of which, as the respective titles
imply, is written in Latin and the other in Italian, but which
are by no means replicas of each other with the language
changed. Both were printed at Venice; and though they came
from different presses, they range very well together, both being
in a smallish quarto, but with very close type, so that the 560
odd pages of the <span lang="la"><cite>De Poeta</cite></span> and the 450 odd of the <span lang="la"><cite>Arte</cite></span> contain
between them a vast amount of matter. The plans of the two
treatises—which are allotted naturally according to their language,
the Latin to poetry in general and to classical verse, the
Italian to its own kind—are not strikingly but slightly different.
The <span lang="la"><cite>De Poeta</cite></span>, which is addressed to Ettore Pignatelli, Duke of
Bivona, takes the time-honoured form of a symposium or
dialogue, the persons being the poet Sannazar (who is always
introduced by his Latin names of Actius Syncerus) and his
friends, and the scene the famous Villa Mergellina. Indeed,
Minturno seems to have written the book at Naples, whence he
dates it a year before that of its appearance. In the later
work he himself is the principal speaker, his antagonists
or interlocutors being Vespasiano Gonzaga in the First book,
Angelo Costanzo in the Second, Bernardino Rota in the Third,
and Ferrante Carafa in the Fourth. The dialogue-form, it may
also be mentioned, is less, and that of the formal treatise more,
prominent in the <span lang="la"><cite>Arte</cite></span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Both volumes have the invaluable accompaniment of side-notes—an
accompaniment which not only makes the writer’s
point more easily intelligible to the reader, but prevents the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>writer himself from straying. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> De Poeta.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But the <span lang="la"><cite>De Poeta</cite></span> is not furnished
with either Contents or Index, while the <span lang="la"><cite>Arte</cite></span>
is liberally provided with both. This, in the first
case, is to be regretted, not merely because the book is much the
longer of the two, but because the indulgences of the dialogic
form are more fully taken in it. After a suitable beginning
(with a <span lang="la"><i>fons</i></span> and a <span lang="la"><i>platanus</i></span> and other properties), the subject is
opened with a panegyric of poetry. The origins of literature
were in verse; all nations practised it. A more sensible line is
taken (it will be understood that the interlocutors of course
take different views, and one judges by the general drift) on the
subject of the all-accomplishment of the poets, than is the case
with some of the writers above mentioned; but Minturno
points out (which is no doubt true enough) that poetry in a
manner “holds all the Arts in fee,” can draw upon and dignify
all. On the connection of verse with poetry he holds a middle
position, close to that of Aristotle himself, and not very different
from that long after taken up by Coleridge in the <span lang="la"><cite>Biographia
Literaria</cite></span>. He will not pronounce verse essential to poetry, but
evidently thinks that poetry would be extremely foolish to dispense
with its practically inseparable companion. The consecrated
procession of poets from Amphion and Orpheus to
Homer and even Virgil is set a-going as usual. Then the
discussion, after a little skirmishing, settles down at p. 22 to
the question of Imitation; and, amid much scholastic subdivision
of its kinds and manners, the delight produced by this is
very strongly insisted on. Next, the Platonic onslaught is discussed,
and urged or repelled by turns; the defence being clearly
the author’s side, and maintained with considerable vigour, and
with plentiful examples from Homer and Virgil both. The line
taken, however, leads Minturno to lay stress on the <em>instructive</em>
power of poetry. The poet’s purpose will, he holds, govern his
imitation, and direct it so as to excite admiration in the reader
or hearer. This is possibly the source of the next-century
endeavour to elevate Admiration to the level of Pity and Terror
themselves.<a id='r78'></a><a href='#f78' class='c019'><sup>[78]</sup></a> Hence Minturno is constrained to share the idea
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>of the necessarily virtuous character of the poet: and, except
that he never separates the <span lang="la"><i>delectare</i></span> from the <span lang="la"><i>prodesse</i></span> altogether,
he hugs the dangerous shore of the <span lang="fr"><i>hérésie de l’enseignement</i></span> too
closely in his endeavour to escape the Platonic privateers. By
degrees the discussion glides into the comparison of Epic and
Tragedy, and the question whether Poetry is a matter of Art
or of Inspiration—and decides that it is both. And the First
Book ends with the pronouncement that a good poet must be
a good man, but that he may sometimes deal with not-good
things.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Second begins with one of the demonstrations (which
to us seem otiose, but which were very important, not merely to
the ideas of the age, but as bulwarks against the Puritan and
Utilitarian objections of all times) that the poets, especially
Homer and Virgil, are masters, whether necessarily or not, of all
the liberal arts and of philosophy as well. When we remember
the Philistine anti-poetics of Locke much more than a century
after Minturno’s time—nay, the still existing, if lurking, idea
that “great poet” must be (as somebody asserts that it is or was
in Irish slang) synonym for “utter fool”<a id='r79'></a><a href='#f79' class='c019'><sup>[79]</sup></a>—we shall not bear too
hardly on our author. But this discussion, in its turn, is bid to
“come up higher.” What is to be the <span lang="la"><cite>Institutio Poetæ</cite></span>? What
is he to do and learn that he may in turn (p. 102) “delight,
teach, <em>transport</em>.”<a id='r80'></a><a href='#f80' class='c019'><sup>[80]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In all cases the admiration of the reader or hearer (p. <a href='#Page_104'>104</a>)
must follow. But it will be obtained not quite in the same
way as by the orator, and with a difference in the different
kinds of poetry. The parts of a poem, too, are dealt with
in a more or less Aristotelian manner, but with large additions
and substitutions, in view of the greater range of literature that
Minturno has before him, and of the desire specially to bring
in Virgil, of whom our critic, though not quite such a fanatical
partisan as Vida and Scaliger, is a hearty admirer (see for
instance p. 135). All the “parts” have more or less attention
in this book, both with reference to the different “kinds,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>especially epic and “heroic,” and also with regard to those
general principles of poetry which Minturno never forgets.
The Third Book of nearly 100 pages is directly devoted to
tragedy; and Minturno pursues in reference to this the same
plan of following, but with a certain independence and a great
deal of expatiation, in Aristotelian footsteps. He still lays
great stress on Admiration; and it is really curious that in
thus forestalling, no doubt, Corneille’s teaching, he has by
anticipation hit at Racine and the <span lang="fr"><i>doucereux</i></span> in a phrase<a id='r81'></a><a href='#f81' class='c019'><sup>[81]</sup></a>
which has been fairly guessed to have supplied Milton with a
famous one<a id='r82'></a><a href='#f82' class='c019'><sup>[82]</sup></a> of his own. He does not pay so much attention
to the <em>crux</em> of the <em>katharsis</em> (on which most of these critics
necessarily dwell more or less) in this treatise as in the <span lang="it"><cite>Arte</cite></span>
(<i>v. infra</i>).</p>

<p class='c000'>The Fourth Book, even longer than the Third, is, like it,
entirely devoted to one subject; and the change of modern
as compared with ancient view is shown strongly by the fact
that this subject is Comedy. The admirers of Plautus and
Terence, the countrymen of Ariosto and Machiavelli, could
not, indeed, be expected to turn from Comedy with the disdainful
shoulder of Aristotle; but such elaborate treatment
as this shows the hold which the subject had obtained. Yet
it is ominous that Minturno devotes especial attention to the
subject of types; though, in accordance with his usual practice,
he gives much space to a general treatment of the Ludicrous
and its sources. There is also a good deal of curious detail
in this Book as to costume and theatrical arrangements
generally. The Fifth turns to Lyric, and sets forth its different
kinds, including Satire among them. And the Sixth deals with
Diction and Prosody, the section allotted to the latter being
comparatively short and interspersed between two on Style,
proceeding of course a good deal by Figures, though not in the
most cut-and-dried manner, and illustrated (as indeed are all
the later Books) by abundant and unceasing quotation. It may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>be observed that, as perhaps might be expected, the dialogue-character
disappears in them more and more, and the book
takes the form of a simple exposition by one or other of the
personages. This change prepares us for the arrangement of
the <span lang="it"><cite>Arte</cite></span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>This book, as dates given and to be given show, was published
subsequently to the appearance of Scaliger’s <cite>Poetic</cite>, and
may have been to some extent influenced by it;
but I do not think that Minturno, who mentions
Trissino and Bembo and Tolomei, ever refers to it, and he does
not give one the idea of a man who would conceal debts. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Arte Poetica.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In
fact, his work upon the same subject had been completed
earlier. In this he has necessarily to go over some of the
same ground; but, as noted above, he repeats very little. He
starts with a general definition of poetry as an imitation of
various manners and persons in various modes, either with
words or with harmonies or with “times” separately, or with
all these things together, or with part of them. Other ternaries
follow, as matter, instrument, and mode; manners, affections,
and deeds; suprahuman, human, and infrahuman; personages;
words, music, and “times”; epic, scenic, and melic; prose,
verse, and mixed narrative. These distinctions are put forth in
an orderly manner, but succinctly and without the discussion
which is a feature of the general parts of the <span lang="la"><cite>De Poeta</cite></span>,
Minturno evidently thinking that he has sufficiently cleared
the ground in that work. After some further exposition of
forms, &#38;c., the handling is more specially directed to Epic (<i>i.e.</i>,
narrative generally), and its parts and conditions are expounded,
still with a certain swiftness, but at greater length than before.
And once more the treatment concentrates itself—this time
upon Romance. The origin of the name and thing is lightly
touched, and then the great question is broached,<a id='r83'></a><a href='#f83' class='c019'><sup>[83]</sup></a> “Is Romance
poetry?” Minturno will not refuse it the name; but he
cannot admit that it is the same kind of poetry as that of
which Aristotle and Horace have spoken. The contrarieties of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>Romance and Heroic poetry are then carefully examined; and
while much praise is given to Ariosto, some fault is found with
him, and the mantle of the <cite>Odyssey</cite> is especially refused him.
In fact, Minturno holds generally that the Romance is a defective
<em>form</em> of poetry, ennobled by the excellence of some of its
writers—a sort of middle position which is very noteworthy.
But he hardens his heart against the irresistible historical and
inductive argument which the defenders of the Romance had
already discovered, and will have it that the laws of poetry
are antecedent to poetic production (p. <a href='#Page_32'>32</a>). And for his main
style of narrative poetry he returns to Epic or “Heroic” proper,
and discusses it on the old lines of Plot, Character, Manners,
Passions or Affections, &#38;c., always with modern examples from
the great Italian poets. He also makes the very important,
but very disastrous, suggestion that the Christian religion provides
all the necessary “machinery” of Heroic,—a suggestion
which was elaborately followed out by Tasso and by Milton
and by many a lesser man, and which Dryden had thought of
following, though he luckily did not.<a id='r84'></a><a href='#f84' class='c019'><sup>[84]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The Second Book takes up Drama in the same manner, but—as
was always made legitimate by the parasitic character of
at least Italian Tragedy—with much more reference to ancient
and less to modern writers. The Third Book deals with Lyric,
the same inclusion of Satire which we have noticed in the
<span lang="la"><cite>De Poeta</cite></span> being made; and the Fourth with Poetic Diction,
Prosody, &#38;c., still on the lines of the earlier treatise, but with
entire adaptation to the Italian subject. The latter books, as
is natural, are much more meticulous in their arrangement,
descending, with complete propriety, to the minutest details of
rhyme and metre, as well as, where necessary, of grammar.
But Minturno never loses an opportunity of ascending to
the higher and more general considerations—the nature of
harmony, the origin and quality of rhyme, &#38;c., the characters
of kinds, and even, to some extent, of authors. It is characteristic
of him to give an elaborate discussion of the Italian
alphabet letter by letter from the poetical point of view, and
to strike off from this to a consideration of the relations of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Italian, Latin, and foreign modern languages, the general
methods of elevating style, and the question whether there
ought to be completely separate diction for poetry and prose.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is the presence of this contrast, or combination, in him
which, as much as anything else, has determined more attention
in this place to Minturno than to some other
authors before noticed. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Their value.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In combination of
thoroughness and range he seems to me to hold a position
both high and rather solitary. He has not quite the elaborate
system of Scaliger, but then he is much less one-eyed; he is
less original—has less <span lang="fr"><i>diable au corps</i></span>—than Castelvetro, but he
is far less eccentric and incalculable. His unfeigned belief in
the noble and general theories of poetry and the poet is set off
by his sedulous attention to particulars, as his attention to
particulars is by his escapes of relief into the region of
generalisation, and by his all-important addition of “transport”
to “teach” and “delight.” He has not reached—he has in
fact declined—the historical antinomianism of Patrizzi (<i>v.</i> next
chap.); but that was inevitable, since this view was in part
a reaction from the movement which he represented, in part
a development of theories contemporary with himself. And
his attitude in regard to the <span lang="it"><cite>Romanzi</cite></span> is a significant sign
of the turn of the tide. Earlier, and in the neo-classics <span lang="fr"><i>quand
même</i></span> later, the fact that a thing differs in kind from the
accepted forms of poetry is proof that it is not poetry at all.
Minturno cannot go this length. It is poetry inferior in kind,
he still insists; but the excellence of those who have adopted
it saves it, no matter to what extent. The concession is fatal.
If Balbus builds a wall contrary to the laws of nature and
architecture, it will not be an inferior wall; it will tumble
down, and not be a wall at all. If he works a sum on
the principle that two and two make five, his answer will
be hopelessly wrong. But if the wall stands, if the sum
comes right, the laws, the principles, cannot be wrong, though
they may be different from others. The infallible and exclusive
Kind-rules of the ancients are doomed to be swept
away through the little gap in the dam that Minturno has
opened.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>The <span lang="fr"><cite>Discorsi</cite></span><a id='r85'></a><a href='#f85' class='c019'><sup>[85]</sup></a> of Giraldi Cinthio—famous author of <span lang="fr"><i>Novelle</i></span>,
and now much less famous, but perhaps not much less remarkable,
producer of the chief Italian horror-tragedy, the
<span lang="it"><cite>Orbecche</cite></span>—supply a very interesting supplement-contrast
to Minturno, whose earlier work they preceded
by but a few years, and whom they provided with a theory of
Romance to protest against. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Giraldi Cinthio’s</i> Discorsi.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The exact date of the most interesting
of them, and the question of property or plagiarism
in their contents, have been the subject of one of those tedious
“quarrels of authors” which are thickening upon us, but which
we shall avoid as far as possible. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>On Romance.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Cinthio and a certain pupil
of his, Giovanbattista Pigna, published in the same year
(1554) books on the “Romances”—<i>i.e.</i>, poems like
Ariosto’s.  Authorities decide in favour of the
novelist, who asserts that his book was written in 1549,
while each asserted that he had furnished the other with
ideas; but it really does not matter. The point is, that on
one of the two, and very probably on both, there had dawned
the critical truth, which nobody had seen earlier, and on
which Minturno himself would have pulled down “the
blanket of the dark” once more if he could. Cinthio,
it seems, first struck out the true line, and Pigna later
developed it in still greater detail. Aristotle did not know
Romance, and therefore his rules do not and cannot apply to
it; while Italian literature generally is so different in circumstances
from Greek that it must follow its own laws. Then
Cinthio takes Ariosto and Boiardo, as Aristotle himself had
taken the poets that were before him, and formulates laws
from them. He does not ostracise the single-action and
single-hero poem, the Aristotelian epic. But he adds the
many-actioned and many-heroed poem like Ariosto’s, and the
chronicle-poem of successive actions by one party, of which
there are examples from Statius downward (and of which, we
may add, the <cite>Odyssey</cite> itself is really an example). For these
two latter, which he rightly regards as both Romantic, he and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Pigna (who is more specially <em>Ariostian</em>) gave rules accordingly,
and Cinthio even illustrated his by a poem on Hercules. Both,
but especially Pigna, despite their revolutionary tendencies
in certain ways, cling to the ethical point of view, and maintain,
perhaps a little hardily, that the modern romantic
writers actually surpass the ancients in this respect.</p>

<p class='c000'>In their main contention Cinthio and Pigna were no doubt
right, and much in advance of their time.  <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>On Drama.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The reply of
Minturno that Poetry may adapt itself to the times,
but cannot depart from its own fundamental laws,
is clearly a <span lang="la"><i>petitio principii</i></span>. In his less important <span lang="it"><cite>Discorso</cite></span> on
the Drama Cinthio is hardly at all rebel to Aristotle—indeed
it is very important to observe that even in the Romance
Essay he has none of the partisan and somewhat illiberal anti-Peripateticism
which we find later in Bruno and others. There
he goes on the solid ground that Aristotle did not know the
Kind for which he does not account—that he was no more
blamable than, as we may say, supposing that he had given a
definition of mammalia which excluded the kangaroo. In the
Drama Cinthio had not been brought face to face with any
similarly new facts. Italian tragedy, his own included, was
scrupulously Senecan, if not quite scrupulously Aristotelian,
in general lines. Italian comedy followed Plautus and Terence
only too closely; and though Cinthio’s lines of criticism
(strengthened by the Ciceronian-Donatist theory of the <span lang="la"><i>speculum
vitæ</i></span>) led him, like Il Lasca and others, to insist on the
different circumstances of Italian literature here also, they
necessitated no new lawmaking as in the case of the <span lang="it"><cite>Romanzi</cite></span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Both <span lang="it"><cite>Discorsi</cite></span> are full of ingenious <span lang="fr"><i>aperçus</i></span>, sometimes followed
out—sometimes not. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Some points in both.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> For instance, when Cinthio (i. 24)
cites his three examples of writers who have
treated their heroes from childhood upwards contrary
to the Aristotelian principles, he instances Xenophon in
the <span lang="la"><cite>Cyropædia</cite></span> as well as Statius and Silius Italicus. The instance
does not in his expressed remarks, but it might very
well in his own or others’ thoughts, lead to the consideration
that whether verse is or is not essential to poetry, it is certainly
<em>not</em> essential to Romance—with all the momentous and far-reaching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>consequences of that discovery. Again he seems
(i. 82) to have appreciated, with a taste and sense rare in his
age, the impropriety of mixing up Christian and Pagan mythology.
And the same taste and sense appear, as a rule, in the
minuter remarks (p. 100 <i>sq.</i>) on verse and phrase, and even on
those minutest points not merely of verbal but of literal criticism
which the Italians, more sensible than some modern critics,
never despised, though they may sometimes have gone to the
other extreme. In fact, the last half, and rather more, of the
<span lang="it"><cite>Discorso</cite></span> is not so much concerned with the Romances as with
poetic diction and arrangement in general, or even with these
matters as concerns literature both in prose and in verse.</p>

<p class='c000'>The dramatic <span lang="it"><cite>Discorso</cite></span>, or rather <span lang="it"><cite>Discorsi</cite></span> (for we may throw
in a third piece on Satiric Composition), is much shorter than
that on the Romances, being necessarily less controversial, and
therefore, as has been said, less original. But Cinthio’s independence
of mind does not desert him even here. He is said to
have been the first Italian who dared, in the <span lang="it"><cite>Orbecche</cite></span> before
mentioned, to disregard the Senecan practice<a id='r86'></a><a href='#f86' class='c019'><sup>[86]</sup></a> (so tedious in all
modern imitations of it, and so crushingly exhibited in our
own earliest tragic attempts) of beginning with an entire scene,
or even act, of monologue. But, as often happens, his licences
in some directions invite condonation by a tighter drawing of
the reins elsewhere. He is credited (or debited) with the first
reference in modern literature to the Unity of Time: and
though it is well always to accept these assertions of priority
with a certain suspension of judgment, it may be so. It is at
any rate certain that he does out-Aristotle Aristotle in regard
to this Unity, upon which, as is well known, the Stagirite lays
very little stress. But he makes some amends by relaxing the
proscription of the happy ending, so long as the proper purging
effects of pity and terror are achieved. He also to some extent
relaxes the extremest stringency of the old rule about trucidations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span><span lang="la"><i>coram populo</i></span>. There <em>may</em> be death on the stage: but
generally the <span lang="fr"><i>bienséances</i></span> of domestic life should be preserved
there. On one point, in which Cinthio has had assigned to him
the position of anti-Aristotelian origin, I venture to differ as to
the interpretation of the <cite>Poetics</cite> themselves, not merely from Mr
Spingarn but from Professor Butcher.<a id='r87'></a><a href='#f87' class='c019'><sup>[87]</sup></a> The later Neo-Classics,
and especially the French, may have made rank too absolute a
qualification of the tragic Hero. But I must say that I think
they had their justification from Aristotle himself, and that
Cinthio is at worst but dotting the <em>i</em>'s of the Stagirite as to
σπουδαῖοι and χρηστοί. His extreme admiration of the
choruses of Seneca (in justification whereof he cites Erasmus)
is not wholly unwarranted. Few modern readers, unfortunately,
know the stately beauty of these artful odes: though of course
his preference (p. 81) of them to “all the Greeks” is wrong,
and was probably occasioned by the very small attention which
most Renaissance writers paid to Æschylus. The elaborate distinctions
which he, like others, seeks to draw between Tragedy
and Comedy from artificial points of view are to some extent
justified by the very absence of such distinctions in Aristotle.
They thought it their duty to supply what they did not find.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Discourse, or rather Letter (for it bears both titles, and
in scale and character rather deserves the latter name) on Satire
is confessedly supplementary to the other <span lang="it"><cite>Discorsi</cite></span>,
and may be at least connected with the fact that the
indefatigable author had himself attempted a satiric piece, <span lang="it"><cite>Egle</cite></span>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>On Satire.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He lays stress on the special connection of the Satire with the
cult of Bacchus, takes into consideration the poetical as well as
the scenic form, mentions the mixed or Varronian variety, and
even extends his view to the Bucolic or Pastoral proper. But
there are only some five-and-twenty pages, and the thing seems
to have been really composed at “request of friends.”</p>

<p class='c000'>From a critic who did so much it would be somewhat unreasonable
to demand more. In fact, though Cinthio did not
go so far along the high historic path of truth as did Patrizzi
thirty years later, he set on that path a firm foot. For the
moment, and in Italy, the <span lang="it"><i>romanzi</i></span> were the true battle-ground;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>just as in England, for instance, that battle-ground was to be
found a little later in the drama. At a period so early as this,
and so close to the actual revolution of the Renaissance, it could
hardly be expected that any one should reach the vantage-ground
of a comprehensive survey of <em>all</em> literature, so as to
deduce from it the positive and enfranchising, and not even
from it the negative and disfranchising, laws of poetry. Not
only had the vernaculars, with the exception of Italian itself,
hardly furnished, at the time when Cinthio wrote, any
modern literature fit to rank with the ancient—not only was it
far too late, or far too early, to expect any one to give mediæval
literature a fair chance with both—but men were still actually
disputing whether the vernaculars had a right to exist. They
were, like his namesake and clansman, to whom we come next,
hinting surprise that any man of genius and culture should employ
these vernaculars when he might write Latin, or, like one
of his antagonists, Celio Calcagnini, aspiring to the disuse of vernacular
for literary purposes altogether. In an atmosphere still
so far from clear, with such heats and mists about, it is no small
credit to Cinthio that, whether moved by mere parochial patriotism
or by the secret feeling that <span lang="la"><i>sua res</i></span> as a novelist was at
question, or by anything else, he heard and caught at the dominant
of the tune of criticism proper.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pigna’s <span lang="it"><cite>I Romanzi</cite></span>,<a id='r88'></a><a href='#f88' class='c019'><sup>[88]</sup></a> whatever we may think of the quarrel
between him and Cinthio, is a book not to be mentioned without
considerable respect, or dismissed with mention
so merely incidental as that given to it above. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Pigna.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It is
mainly, but not solely, a defence of Ariosto, and has not a few
merits,—a just conception of the essentially Romantic nature of
the <cite>Odyssey</cite>, a very careful and in the main sensible discussion
of Prosody, and a widish comparison of instances. The main
defect of it is the besetting sin of the whole three centuries
with which this volume deals—the Obsession of the Kind.
Instead of being satisfied with the demonstration (which he and
Cinthio had reached) that Romance is not Epic, and is not
bound by Epic laws, Pigna torments himself to show that
Romance <em>is</em> Epic in this particular, not-Epic in that, and is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>alternately subject to and free from bondage: while some of
his detailed investigations may raise smile, or sigh, or shrug,
according to mood or temperament. Thus for instance he
inquires (after a fashion which we shall find echoed in Ronsard)
into the character of the objects—Lance, Horn, Ring—with
which <span lang="la"><i>fatura</i></span> (fairy agency) is usually associated, till we feel
inclined to say, “O learned and excellent signor, the poet may
put <span lang="la"><i>fatura</i></span> in a warming-pan—if he pleases, and can do it <span lang="la"><i>poeticamente</i></span>!”
But the book is, on the whole, a good book: and
Pigna deserves to rank with Cinthio and Patrizzi as one of the
Three who, alone in this first modern stage, saw, if but afar-off
and by glimpses, the Promised Land from which the ship of
criticism was to be once more driven by adverse winds for
centuries to come.</p>

<p class='c000'>A document of exceptional importance for us is provided by
the two curious dialogues <span lang="la"><cite>De Poetis Nostrorum Temporum</cite></span><a id='r89'></a><a href='#f89' class='c019'><sup>[89]</sup></a> of
Lilius Gregorius Giraldus, written about 1548-50,

partly to Cardinal Rangoni. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Lilius Giraldus: his</i> De Poetis Nostrorum Temporum.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Lilius, who was now

of the better class, and a sincere Catholic possessed of
sufficient independence of current ill-fashions to speak
with severity of the verses of Beccadelli, would seem also
to have been, at first- or second-hand, a man of very wide
literary knowledge. His acquaintance with More<a id='r90'></a><a href='#f90' class='c019'><sup>[90]</sup></a> might be
partly (as his very high estimate is certainly) conditioned by
ecclesiastical partisanship; but he speaks of Wyatt long before
<cite>Tottel’s Miscellany</cite> made that poet’s works publicly known,
even in his own country, and, what is still more remarkable, of
Chaucer.<a id='r91'></a><a href='#f91' class='c019'><sup>[91]</sup></a> <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Its width of range.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Neither France nor Germany is excluded with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>usual Italian uppishness,<a id='r92'></a><a href='#f92' class='c019'><sup>[92]</sup></a> though Giraldus cannot help slipping
the word <span lang="la"><i>barbarus</i></span> more than once off his tongue.
And though Italy herself has, as we should expect,
the lion’s share, yet the process of sharing is not pursued to
that extreme of ridiculous arrogance which has been shown by
the Greeks in their decadence, by the French in their Augustanism,
and by the Italians themselves more than once.</p>

<p class='c000'>But this real knowledge on Giraldus’ part, and the fairness of
his spirit, only serve to accentuate the drift in the course and
direction of this, the most important general summary
of its kind that we meet between the <span lang="la"><cite>Labyrinthus</cite></span> and
the seventeenth century. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>But narrowness of view.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Giraldus, though he does not absolutely
exclude the vernaculars, is perfectly convinced that poetry,
and indeed literature generally, means—first of all, and as far
as its aristocracy goes exclusively—writing in Latin; nay, with
him even translation from the classical languages is a more
important thing than original composition in the vulgar tongue.
<span class='sni side12'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Horror at preference of vernacular to Latin.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
His contempt of this latter is thinly though decently veiled in
the passage on drama (<i>ed. cit.</i>, p. 40), where, speaking of the
writers of comedy, and rightly preferring Ariosto to Bibbiena,
he says, <span lang="la">“sed enim vernaculo sermone id plerique opus aggressi
pauci mea sententia assecuti sunt;”</span> speaks (with a sort of visible
shake of the head, as over a good man lost) of Ariosto himself
as one who “<span lang="la">Latino carmine aliquando ludit, sed nunc totum
se vernaculis tradidit, atque inter cetera furentem Orlandum
dare curat in publicum;</span>”<a id='r93'></a><a href='#f93' class='c019'><sup>[93]</sup></a> patronisingly remarks of Trissino’s
projected <span lang="it"><cite>Sophonisba</cite></span>, that if the whole of it is as good as the
acts that the author recites, <span lang="la">“erit, <em>licet vernacula ipsa</em>, Latinorum
tamen non indigna lectione,”</span> wonders at this George who
“<span lang="la">est ipse et Græce et Latine bene doctus, at nunc
fere in vernaculis conquiescit,</span>” and ends with an
impatient “<span lang="la">Verum de vernaculis jam satis,</span>” and
a mutter about <span lang="la"><i>tonsores sellulariique</i></span>. He speaks
still less ambiguously later (ibid., p. 85), where cobblers and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>other dregs of the people are added to barbers and mechanics
in general (as a tail to a list headed by Boiardo, Pulci, Politian,
and Lorenzo de' Medici!), and at last liberates his real feeling
in a sentence, which many very excellent men in all European
countries would have indorsed till nearly the end of the
eighteenth century, “<span lang="la">Ex quo nescioqui viri alioqui docti <span lang="la"><i>in
eam hæresim</i></span> incidere ut non modo vernaculas velint Latinis
litteris æquare verum etiam anteponere, quin et id etiam
litteris prodidere.</span>” “Whence some persons, in other respects
learned, have fallen into such a heresy that they not only
choose to make the vernaculars equal with Latin, but even
to set them above it—nay, they have actually given literary
expression to the doctrine.” A terrible thing to Humanists,
and, alas! one to which they have since had to make up their
minds! Unfortunately, the two great classical languages now
pay, and for some time to come are likely to continue paying,
the penalty of this idle miscalculation and <span lang="la"><i>outrecuidance</i></span> on
the part of their mistaken partisans; and it is the first duty
of all lovers of letters <em>now</em> to fight for their maintenance in
due place.</p>

<p class='c000'>But still the almost invincible equity of the man displays
itself even in his judgment of these unhappy schismatics; and
he seems to make some difference between the vernacular dialects
and the <span lang="it"><cite>Sermo Etruscus</cite></span>. On Berni, Alamanni, the two
“gentlewomen-poetesses,” as the Italians call them, Vittoria
Colonna and Veronica Gambara, Speroni, La Casa, Aonio Paleario,
Molza, he has things amiable and acute at once to say.</p>

<p class='c000'>But his heart is not here, nor in the mention of the poor
barbarous foreigners who may perhaps have some better excuse
than “Latins” for not writing in the Latin tongue.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Yet a real critic in both kinds.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It is of those who do so write—Italians first of
all but also others—that he really thinks as “the
poets of his time.” He can find room for a mere grammarian
(though a very excellent grammarian) like William Lilly: he
speaks of him <span lang="it"><cite>magnificentissime</cite></span>, and if this notice contrasts
rather comically with the brief and cold reference to Erasmus,
it is fair to remember not merely that Erasmus was by no
means <span lang="la"><i>persona grata</i></span> to the Roman orthodox, but that his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>poetical work is really nothing as compared with his exquisite
prose.</p>

<p class='c000'>He begins with the two Mirandolas, Pontanus, Marullus, and
Sannazar, and is copious though not uncritical on them all: <span lang="la"><i>non
numquam nimis lascivire et vagari videtur</i></span>, he says of Pontanus.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Short</i> précis <i>of the dialogues</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Recalled by his interlocutor to still earlier writers, he has the
judgment of “the Panormitan”<a id='r94'></a><a href='#f94' class='c019'><sup>[94]</sup></a> (Beccadelli), which has been
noticed, and a by no means unremarkable one, dwelling ominously
on the “facility” of Mapheus Vegius, the egregious person who
took upon himself to write a thirteenth <cite>Æneid</cite>. Many forgotten
worthies (among whom Filelfo and the better Aretines, Charles
and Leonard, are the least forgotten) lead us (for Bembo and
Sadolet have had their position earlier, and will have it again)
to a famous pair, Mantuan and Politian. Giraldus
is decisive and refreshing on Mantuan. This loudly
over-praised poet is <span lang="la"><i>extemporalis magis quam poeta
maturus</i></span>, and as to his being <span lang="la"><i>alter Maro</i></span>, why <span lang="la">“Bone Deus! quam
dispar ingenium!”</span><a id='r95'></a><a href='#f95' class='c019'><sup>[95]</sup></a> He is much more favourable to the author
of the <span lang="it"><cite>Nutricia</cite></span> and the <span lang="it"><cite>Manto</cite></span>, but does not forget his swashing
blow even here. Politian seems to him to have written <span lang="la"><i>calore
potius quam arte</i></span>, and to have used little diligence either in
choosing his subjects or correcting his work. The Strozzi and
Urceus Codrus follow, with many minor lights, from the notices
of whom the judgment on Ludovicus Bigus Pictorius of Ferrara
stands out as applicable, unfortunately, to some greater men and
many as small or smaller. <span lang="la">“Cum pius deflexit ad religionem,
ut vita melior ita carmine deterior visus est.”</span> Then one of the
regulation pieces of flattery as to the Augustan character of the
rule of <span lang="la"><i>Leo Maximus</i></span> conducts us to notices of Naugerius and
Vida, where the moderate and deserved praise of the first
would contrast oddly (if we did not know how the pseudo-classical
tradition for two hundred years and more said vehement
“ditto” to Giraldus) with the extravagant eulogies on
the polished emptiness of the latter. And then a great <span lang="it"><i>turba</i></span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>comes, among which the two Beroalds, Acciauoli and, among
blind poets, Bello, the author of the <span lang="it"><cite>Mambriano</cite></span>, chiefly take
the eye.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have noted the condescension to such poor vernacular
creatures as Ariosto, Bibbiena, and (with a long interval certainly)
Trissino and the author of the first <span lang="it"><cite>Rosmunda</cite></span>. It is succeeded
by another review of persons long relinquished to dusty shelves
and memories, with a few better known names like Molza and
Longolius. The praise of the great Fracastorius is much more
moderate than we might have expected—probably Giraldus did
not like his subject—and then there is a curious passage on
“fancy” verses, leonine, serpentine, and others, leading to yet
another, in which the worse side of the Renaissance—its contempt
for the Middle Ages—is shown by a scornful reference
to <span lang="la"><cite>Architrenios et Anti-claudianos</cite></span>, which finishes the first dialogue.
The second is of a wider cast, but needs less minute
account here, though it is at least as well worth reading. It
begins with the Greeks, who did so much for Italy, from
Gemistus Pletho and Chrysoloras downwards, then takes the
Spaniards and Portuguese, then our own countrymen, then the
Germans and French. Here comes the description of Erasmus
as <span lang="la"><i>inter Germanos Latinus inter Latinos aliquando Germanus</i></span>;
and here Giraldus frankly confesses that he is not going to
say anything about persons like Œcolampadius, Bucer, Sturm,
and Melanchthon, since they were not contented to confine
themselves to good literature, and would know too much, and
trouble Israel with Luther. But a good word is spared, justly,
for the author of the <cite>Basia</cite>, with a reversion to still younger
men, among whom Palingenius, Julius Cæsar Scaliger, and
Castelvetro are the best known, and with the final fling at the
vernaculars above given.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such a book, with its wonderful width of range<a id='r96'></a><a href='#f96' class='c019'><sup>[96]</sup></a> and its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>sometimes equally wonderful contraction of view, is worth,
to the historian of real criticism, a dozen long-winded
tractates hunting the old red-herrings of
critical theory. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Their great historic value.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The <span lang="la"><cite>De Poetis Nostrorum Temporum</cite></span>
gives us one of those veritable and inestimable rallying-points
of which our History should be little more than a reasoned
catalogue, connected by summary of less important phenomena.
Referring duly to it, we find ourselves at the standpoint of a
man who has really wide knowledge, and who, when his general
assumptions do not interfere, has a real critical grasp. But the
chief of these assumptions is not merely that the vernaculars
have not attained equality with the classics—this, allowing for
inevitable defects of perspective and other things, would not
be fatal—but that they cannot attain such equality, much
less any superiority. The point of view—to us plain common-sense—that
if Sannazar and others wrote in Latin about
Christian subjects, they should use Christian Latin, seems to
Giraldus the point of view of a kind of maniac. Without the
details and developments of Vida, he is apparently in exact
accordance with that excellent Bishop. Cicero and Virgil, not
to mention others, have achieved for literature a medium which
cannot be improved upon, and all those who adopt any other
are, if not exactly wicked, hopelessly deceived and deluded.
This is the major premiss for practically every syllogism of our
critic. Where it does not come in—between vernacular and
vernacular, between Latin and Latin of the classical type—he
can judge just judgment. Where it comes in, the more perfect
his logic, the more inevitably vitiated is his conclusion.</p>

is rather dangerous to say that Savonarola,
in connecting poetry with logic,
was “tending towards the elimination
of the Imagination in art.” The extremely
equivocal nature of the word

I take the opportunity of correcting an
injustice to Trissino which I committed
at i. 417, and which was brought to my
notice by a reviewer in the <cite>Athenæum</cite>.
“Giovan- [or Giam-] battista Doria”
<em>does</em> say, in his dedication to the Cardinal
de' Medici, that Dante wrote it in
Latin, adding, however, a clause of such
singular obscurity that at first sight
one takes it as meaning that Dante
<em>himself</em> translated the book into Italian.

<p class='c000'><a href='#r77'>77</a>. Robortello edited Ælian and Æschylus
as well as Longinus and Aristotle;
Petrus Victorius was busied very
widely with the classics. The combined
treatment of Aristotle and Horace
by the former in his <span lang="la"><cite>Explicationes</cite></span>
(Basle, 1555) is distinctly noteworthy.
His dealings with the Greek are almost
pure commentary; those with the Roman,
though called a “Paraphrase,”
are much freer. He begins with a sort
of expository lecture on the <span lang="la"><cite>Epistola ad
Pisones</cite></span>, introducing most of its matter
and much illustration from other
authors. Then separate short essays
follow on Satire, Epigram, Comedy,
<em>Sales</em>, and Elegy. The heading “Sales”
is especially worthy of attention as illustrating
that tormenting preoccupation
of the classics on Wit, which transmitted
itself to the Renaissance, and is
found in moderns as recent as Whately.
Robortello exercised much authority,
and is shown by M. Morel-Fatio in
his recent edition of Lope de Vega’s
<span lang="es"><cite>Arte Nuevo</cite></span> (<i>v. infra</i>, p. 343) to have
furnished the Spanish poet with much,
if not most, of the miscellaneous erudition
which he displays to no great
purpose. Robortello’s earlier <span lang="la"><i>editio
princeps</i></span> of Longinus (ibid., 1554) is
noteworthy in a different way. He
was by no means more modest than
the average Renaissance scholar; on
the contrary, he is accused of special
arrogance. But this <span lang="la"><i>opus redivivum,
antea ignotum, e tenebris in lucem
editum</i></span>, as he calls it, seems to have
puzzled, if not actually abashed, him.
He has no introduction, no regular
commentary: only side-headings of the
matter, from which, he says, “all the
method of the book, and the order of
the questions treated, and the whole
rationale of the teaching,” and much
else, can be learnt. The spirit was too
potent for him who had called it up. Of
other mainly classical commentators,
Riccoboni (<span lang="la"><cite>Compendium Artis Poeticæ</cite></span>,
1591) is again useful, because he combines
Horace and Aristotle, and practicalises
the combination, identifying
the Aristotelian or pseudo-Aristotelian
(see vol. i. p. 34) “Episode” with the
first Four Acts, the Exodus with the
Fifth, &#38;c. Maggi, Segni, Zabarella are
even farther from our sphere.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the remarkable little book, a notice of which concluded the
last chapter, Lilius Giraldus, as we observed, includes—for their
verse-work nominally, as became his title, but, with
his usual acuteness, obviously perceiving that their
importance lay elsewhere—both of the most famous and influential
critics of the central sixteenth century in Italy. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Julius Cæsar Scaliger.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> His
reference to Julius Cæsar Scaliger (who was, indeed, not more
than six years younger than himself) contains some touches
(such as the mention of him by the name he took, but with the
addition “<span lang="la">qui primus Bordonus cognomine fuit,</span>” and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>description of his book on Comic Metres, as “arranged with
such wonderful subtlety as not to be intelligible save to a
reader well versed in the subject”) which are of doubtful
friendliness, but allows the Veronese gladiator to be <span lang="la"><i>apprime
eruditus</i></span> and capable of <span lang="la"><i>carmina elegantia</i></span>. For us nothing of
Scaliger’s needs detailed notice except the once world-famous
and still famous <span lang="la"><cite>Poetices Libri Septem</cite></span>,<a id='r97'></a><a href='#f97' class='c019'><sup>[97]</sup></a> which appeared in 1561
after the death of Giraldus, and indeed after his own.</p>

<p class='c000'>Scaliger was very much better qualified than Boileau to be
<span lang="fr"><i>législateur du Parnasse</i></span> in the sense in which both understood
Parnassus: or perhaps it would be better to say that without
a Scaliger a Boileau would have been impossible. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Poetic.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He had
immense learning; he had absolute confidence in his own
judgment; and within limits which, if they reduce his positive
value, make him an even more complete and direct exponent of
his own particular school and creed, he had great acuteness, an
orderly and logical spirit, and a thorough command of method.
Nothing (certain inevitable postulates being granted) can be
more luminous and intelligible than the book, in which the
author, through all his thousand pages, never loses sight, nor
permits his reader to lose sight, of the subject, the process,
and the goal. That he stands forth in the preface to his son
Sylvius with an air of patronage at once paternal and pedagogic,
announcing himself as the pioneer of the subject, dismissing
those who allege Varro, as with levity ignoring the fact that
neither Varro nor anybody else in antiquity did, or could do,
anything of the kind: that he blandly sweeps away the <span lang="la"><i>plebs
grammaticorum</i></span>; that he labels the <span lang="la"><cite>Ars Poetica</cite></span> itself as teaching
<span lang="la"><i>adeo sine ulla arte ut saturæ propius esse videatur</i></span>,
Aristotle as fragmentary, Vida as <span lang="la"><i>optimus poeta in
theatro, claudus magister in schola</i></span>—is all of it agreeably Scaligerian
in manner. But it is far from being untrue in fact.
And there is a touch of sublimity in the <span lang="la"><i>Quare porro opera danda
est nobis</i></span>, “wherefore <em>we</em> must put our shoulders to the wheel,”
with which he concludes. “Let others grub money, or canvass
for office, or talk about the wars as parasite guests at dinner:
we will let them alone, and simply defend the nobility of our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>studies, the magnanimity and simplicity of our purpose.”
After this magnificent pose and draping, and before commendatory
verses (the main copy being by no less a person than
Etienne de La Boétie) comes a table of contents of antique
clearness and solidity, filling nearly a dozen pages, by means of
which, and of the more than sixty of index at the end, the study
of the text is not a little facilitated.</p>

<p class='c000'>The First Book has the special title, <span lang="la"><i>Qui et Historicus</i></span>, which
it deserves, if not exactly or exclusively in our sense of History.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Book I.</i>: Historicus.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The critic begins, scholastically enough, with
a distribution of everything into necessary, useful,
or delightful, and proceeds to apply the classification in a beneficial
manner to literary expression in general and Poetry in
particular, ending the chapter with a characteristic gibe (for
Scaliger is far from unhumorous) at the moderns who confine
the appellation “Makers” to candle-makers.<a id='r98'></a><a href='#f98' class='c019'><sup>[98]</sup></a> Then he follows
the safe road by discussing the causes (material, formal, &#38;c.) of
poetry; and indulges in a free review (for Scaliger, to do him
justice, is <span lang="la"><i>paratus nullius jurare in verba</i></span>) of ancient opinions.
Hence he sets off to a full enumeration and examination, not
merely of the kinds of poetry, but (in connection more especially
with the drama) of the theatres and games of the ancients.
Nothing escapes the extensive view of his observation, neither
palinodes nor parodies, neither centos nor enigmas. And he is
intensive as well as extensive. He rebukes, in his usual magisterial
manner, the <span lang="la"><i>Græculas nugas</i></span> of Plutarch, who explains
the number of the Muses by that of the letters in the name of
their mother, Mnemosyne; and as for Plato’s blame of poetry,
<span lang="la"><i>respiceat ipse sese quot ineptas quot spurcas fabellas inserat</i></span>.<a id='r99'></a><a href='#f99' class='c019'><sup>[99]</sup></a> The
distinction of <span lang="la"><i>Poesis</i></span>, <span lang="la"><i>Poema</i></span>, and <span lang="la"><i>Poeta</i></span>, which follows (and which
many grave writers, including Ben, copy), we have often met in
kind or in itself before, nor is it quite so meticulous as it looks.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>For Scaliger utilises it to stop the blunder of Plutarch and
others, who make a distinction in kind between great poems and
smaller ones. It is tempting but impossible to follow him
through the multitudinous, though far from mazy, ramifications
of his plan. It must be enough to say that he leaves few items
of the dictionary of his subject untouched, and (however inclined
one may be to cry “Halt and fight!” at not a few of his
definitions) formulates them with a roundness and a touch of
confident mastery which fully explain, and to some extent
justify, the practical dictatorship which he so long enjoyed.
As thus (at the opening of chap. vi. p. 27), “Tragedy, like
Comedy established in examples of human life, differs from it
in three things—the condition of the persons, the quality of the
fortunes and actions, the end. Whence it is necessary that it
should also differ in style.” And this legislative calmness is
accompanied and fortified by a profusion of erudite example,
which might well awe the disciple.</p>

<p class='c000'>The second book, <i>Qui et Hyle</i>, gives us an important point at
once, in the fact that this <em>hyle</em>—this “material” of poetry—is
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Book II.</i>: Hyle.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
frankly acknowledged to be verse.<a id='r100'></a><a href='#f100' class='c019'><sup>[100]</sup></a> The entire
book is occupied, at the rate of a chapter apiece,
after the half-dozen general ones which open it, with almost
every classical metre, if not from pyrrhic to dochmiac, at least
from iambic to galliambic. A great number of interesting dicta
might be extracted from this book—as, for instance, Scaliger’s
remarkable distinction of Rhythm and Metre, as giving, the
latter the more exact <em>measure</em> of the line, the former its continuity
and “temperament.”<a id='r101'></a><a href='#f101' class='c019'><sup>[101]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>The third, <span lang="la"><cite>Qui et Idea</cite></span>, is far longer than either of the preceding,
and is less easily describable to modern readers. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Books III. and IV.</i>: Idea <i>and</i> Parasceve.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Those
who have read the first volume of this book with
some care will understand it without much difficulty,
if we call it a throwing of the traditional and technical
treatment of Rhetoric into a form suitable to
Poetry. Prosopopœia and ethopœia; the bearings or “colours”
of time, place, race, sex, and the rest; the considerations of
chance and manners and fortune; lead us to our old friends
the Figures. To these, giving them the most liberal interpretation
possible, so as to include fresh kinds of poetry as well as
actual turns of speech, Scaliger complacently allows nearly a
hundred out of the nearly hundred and thirty chapters of this
overgrown Book, comprising by itself nearly a full quarter of
the volume. Nor does even this devotion to Figures satisfy him,
for the Fourth Book, <i>Qui et Parasceve</i> (preparation), beginning
with the characters or distinctions of style, turns before long to
more Figures, and is, in fact, a sort of Part II. of the Third.
Naturally, there is no part of the book more difficult to analyse,
but, as naturally, there is none in which analysis is less required.
Scaliger luxuriates in his opportunities of sub-division
and sub-definition; but he abounds ever more and more in
those examples which we have recognised as, from the time
of Hermogenes downwards, the “solace of this sin,” and the
plentifulness of which in Scaliger himself would, even if they
stood alone, go some way to atone for the absence of a larger
examination of writers as wholes. And he does not allow us
to lack even this.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another pair of Books, the Fifth (<i>Qui et Criticus</i>) and the
Sixth (<i>Qui et Hypercriticus</i>), together constitute the
pith and body of the book in spirit, and occupy more
than a third of it in space. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Books V. and VI.</i>: Criticus <i>and</i> Hypercriticus.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It is here that Scaliger
lets himself and his learning loose. The Fifth Book
consists of a vast series of cross-comparisons, Homer with Virgil,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>Greeks with Latins, Virgil with Greeks other than Homer,
Horace and Ovid with Greeks, Latins with other Latins, special
subject-passages of the same theme from different authors. Its
sequel, the <i>Hypercriticus</i>, undertakes, for the first time, an actual
survey of <span lang="fr"><i>belles lettres</i></span> as Scaliger understood them, beginning,
after an odd discussion of Plautus and Terence, with the Renaissance
Humanists (many Italians and a few Germans and French),
and then receding through three Ages (the Middle disdainfully
excluded), to Catullus and Horace. Here, of course, one
may, according to taste or temperament, most revel in, or most
shudder away from, “criticism of criticism.” Here the citation
is most opulent and useful. Here, above all, the most hostile
judge must be forced to admire and acknowledge the erudition
which not merely for the first time attempts, but for the first
time completely meets the initial requirements of, a complete
examination of poetic literature on a definite and reasoned basis.
But here, inevitably, the weakness of Scaliger comes out most
strongly, as well as his strength. Not only was his judgment
warped in more ways than one by prejudice, but we are, with
all the goodwill in the world, forced before long to conclude<a id='r102'></a><a href='#f102' class='c019'><sup>[102]</sup></a>
that his taste itself was radically defective. Nor does this
conclusion rest merely on his preference (anticipated by Vida
and others, and almost an article of national faith) of Virgil to
Homer. His estimate of Musæus also as far superior to Homer,
as incomparable among Greeks, as “worthy of Virgil,” speaks
this taste only too well; and the fearless good faith with which,
disdaining the “guile that lurks in generals,” he quotes line
after line as specially beautiful, delivers him into our hands, a
respectable but self-convicted victim. After this the “coldness”
and “childishness” and “unsuitability” of the Homeric epithet,
the “semper-august” character of Virgil, and innumerable other
things of the kind, disturb us not. Scaliger’s idol has spoken
Scaliger’s doom in <span lang="la"><cite>Qui Bavium non odit</cite></span>—not, of course, that
<cite>Hero and Leander</cite> is itself by any means Bavian, but that it
is so in comparison with Homer. Nearly a hundred pages are
given up to this main comparison of Homer and Virgil. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>others are shorter, but always result in the same dogged maintenance
of the superiority of Latins to Greeks—that is to say,
the same involuntary confession of Scaliger’s preference of
Rhetoric to Poetry. It is interesting, however, to find him
conducting his comparisons in a way in which, as in most other
cases, posterity for two centuries thronged to follow him—the
assemblage, that is to say, of passages on the same subject from
different poets.</p>

<p class='c000'>Still less can we abstract the curious and invaluable survey
of the <span lang="la"><cite>Hypercriticus</cite></span>. Not a little of it is actual review of actual
contemporaries or very recent predecessors, and review of the
ancients takes the same form, reinforced constantly by discussed
quotations. Sometimes, as in the case of Juvenal, these are arranged
into a little anthology of “jewels five words long,” strung
together with <span lang="la"><i>acute et hoc, illud valde festivum</i></span>, and the like appreciative
interjections. His preference of Juvenal to Horace
is seasoned with a characteristic fling at Erasmus (p. 876).</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Book VII.</i>: Epinomis.</div>

<p class='c000'>Lastly comes an <span lang="la"><cite>Epinomis</cite></span> or Codicil, which is divided into
two parts, and takes up some of the special points of poetical
or dramatic criticism then most interesting—the
relative importance of action and character, the
parts of tragedy, the Chorus, the metres most appropriate to
the stage, and the like, ending with a sort of “gratillity” or
bonus in the shape of an examination of a codex of Terence,
which we could spare, at least in this place. More piquant, at
least, are the diatribes <span lang="la"><i>de negligentia aut inscitia professorum</i></span>,
directed (with a show of respect) against Erasmus once more;
the occasional flights, such as “Variety is the <em>tirewoman</em> of
poetry”<a id='r103'></a><a href='#f103' class='c019'><sup>[103]</sup></a> (p. 906); the amusing references to <span lang="la"><i>mea poemata</i></span>, which
in some parts of the book he has obligingly, and once more with
a fearlessness drawing nigh to rashness, exposed to the arrows;
and other things which are perhaps here all the more numerous
because the Book is an avowed Appendix, and, as it were,
<span lang="la"><i>omnium gatherum</i></span>. They are, however, plentiful everywhere;
and if it were possible to revive the old periodical Literary
Miscellanies of commonplace-book character—a thing which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>will have to be done sooner or later, if the accumulations of the
last few centuries are not to became mere Nineveh-mounds,
as yet unexplored—I should like to compose a <span lang="la"><i>florilegium</i></span> of
memorabilia out of Scaliger.</p>

<p class='c000'>For in this great space, occupied with equal method and
erudition, it could not be but that remarkable pronouncements
on the more general questions of literary criticism,
whether given <span lang="la"><i>obiter</i></span> or in definite reference to argued
questions, should emerge. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>General ideas on Unity and the like.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Scaliger is, indeed, less
set than most of his predecessors in Italian criticism,
and than some at least of his successors, on these general pronouncements.
“The disinterested and philosophic treatment of
æsthetic problems wholly aside from all practical considerations,”
as the tendency of Italian criticism has been rather
unguardedly characterised,<a id='r104'></a><a href='#f104' class='c019'><sup>[104]</sup></a> does not seem to have had the
first attraction for him. Yet he could not, in the wide sweep
of his net, have avoided such questions if he would; and, with
his fearless temper and eager literary interests, there is no
reason to suppose that he would have avoided them if he could.
He did not explicitly enjoin the Three Unities,<a id='r105'></a><a href='#f105' class='c019'><sup>[105]</sup></a> but he did more
than any other man had done to inculcate that unfortunate
notion of “verisimilitude”<a id='r106'></a><a href='#f106' class='c019'><sup>[106]</sup></a> from which, much more than from
Aristotle, they were deduced. Not many words need be wasted
(especially as the point will recur only too often during the
volume) on the absurdity of this wresting of <span lang="la"><i>Incredulus odi</i></span>.
The whole arrangements of the theatre are <span lang="fr"><i>invraisemblables</i></span>, no
matter whether you have electric light or cross-shaped laths
with candles on them, marquises sitting on the stage or millionaires
in stage-boxes, elaborate scenery or directions to the
audience, “Here is Thebes.” You do not murder, or (if you
can help it) make love, in real life, before a miscellaneous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>audience who have paid to see you do it; in real life you do
not talk in any regular stage lingo that has hitherto been
invented, whether the outward form of it be senarii, or fourteeners,
or complicated rhymed stanzas, or doggerel, or couplet,
or blank verse, or stage prose. The sixteenth century <i>Globe</i>,
and the twentieth century <i>Lyceum</i>, are alike unlike any place in
which one habitually performs any action of life from birth,
through marriage, to death. That there <em>is</em> a stage verisimilitude,
which it is dangerous or fatal to break, need not be
denied. But neither Scaliger nor any of his successors in
purism has proved that we are, or ought to be, any more
shocked by Æschylus when he shifts from Delphi to Athens
than by Thackeray when he transports us from Flanders to
Chelsea.</p>

<p class='c000'>We may venture indeed to suspect that Scaliger “had more
wit than to be here.” One may frequently differ with him;
but he seldom runs mad on mere theory. It is he, for instance,
who, while, as we have seen, he lays down uncompromisingly that
the material of poetry is verse, instances the <span lang="la"><cite>Æthiopica</cite></span> as a
perfect epic. Instead of confusing poetry and learning, as some
have done, he holds the much more sensible position that learning
is useful to a poet. He takes the hard-and-fast ethical view
of the ends both of tragedy and of all poetry, and he believes
firmly in the type. But he does not bemuse himself, as some
had done and more were to do, in the explanation of <em>katharsis</em>,
and the definition of the tragic hero.</p>

<p class='c000'>His greatest and also his most pervading critical fault is
that “deification of Virgil,” whereof, though by no means the
inventor, he was the chief prophet to the best part
of three centuries. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His Virgil-worship.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Let it be admitted (with every
possible emphasis on the fact that it is no mere extorted admission
but a genuine and spontaneous opinion) that anybody
is free to admire Virgil or any one else as much as he likes.
“She that is fair to him” <em>is</em> so, and there’s an end on’t. But
if any one proceed, not merely to intimate indifference to other
fair ones, but to find positive fault with them because they are
not like her, then he becomes at once uncritical: still more so
if he erect her qualities, features, style, into abstract virtues
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>and positive truths, all opposites to which are sin and vileness.
He may call “Simula Silene, nervosa et lignea Dorcas,” to
take two only out of the famous list in the classic place of this
matter. But he must not declare that a girl who has a straight
Grecian nose is therefore ugly, or that softness and plumpness
are not excellent things in woman. Scaliger does this. For
him Virgil is, at once, the standard of excellence and the infallible
touchstone of defect. Nay, he is actually a better
Nature; a wiser but more perfect Creation, whereby you may
save yourself the trouble of outside imitation, inasmuch as
everything worth imitating is there better done than by Nature
herself. It is impossible to exaggerate or caricature Scaliger’s
Maronolatry: as the Highfliers did in the case of Defoe’s
<cite>Shortest Way</cite>, he would cheerfully accept and indorse the most
outrageous statement of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Grave, however, as is this fault, and seriously as it vitiates
Scaliger’s attitude as a critic, there is no doubt that it served in
itself as the backbone of that attitude, and gave it the stiffness
which enabled it to resist at once argument and time. A cause
of disquiet to some critics themselves, and a rallying-cry to most
enemies of criticism, has been constantly found in the apparently
floating and uncertain character of the completest
critical orthodoxy. Longinus himself, perhaps the best exponent
of that orthodoxy, has been and is charged with
vagueness; and all those who follow him must lay their
account with the same accusation. In the last resort we often
cannot give a clear, definite, cut-and-dried reason for the faith
that is in us, and we still oftener had better not try to do so.
Scaliger and Scaligerism are in no such plight. Their <span lang="la"><cite>Sortes
Virgilianæ</cite></span> are <span lang="la"><i>ex hypothesi</i></span> decisive, and of universal application.
What is found in Virgil is good, is the best; what
is different from Virgil is bad or mediocre; what is like Virgil
is good in direct proportion to the likeness. This of itself gives
confidence both to the critic and to his disciples.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again, Scaliger, though he has no more right to arrogate
Reason and Nature as on his side than the rest of
his school, possesses, like all of the best of them,
a certain sturdy <span lang="la"><i>prima facie</i></span> common-sense. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His solid merits.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It is this which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>dictates his theory of dramatic verisimilitude; this which
palliates some of his Homeric and other blasphemies. Though
uncompromisingly moral, and by no means illogical (when you
have once granted his bundle of postulates), he is not in
the least metaphysical. The wayfaring man, with tolerable
intelligence and a very little trouble, can understand him
perfectly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Still more unmixed praise can be given to him from other
points of view. To any scholar his scholarship is singularly
refreshing in its thoroughness and range; he really neglects
nothing proper to his subject, though he may define that subject
with a somewhat arbitrary hand. Agree with him or
differ with him as we may, it is an infinite comfort to be
brought thus in contact and confrontation with the actual
texts—to exchange the paper symbols of “the poet,” “the
dramatist,” “the satirist” in the abstract, for sound ringing coin
of actual poetry, drama, satire, told down on the counter, and
tested by file and acid if required. The literary atlas of the
<span lang="la"><cite>Hypercriticus</cite></span> is, as has been said, the first attempt at a complete
thing of the kind since Quintilian, and of necessity far more
complete than his. In fact, Scaliger taught the school opposed
to him—the school which after many a generation of desultory
fighting at last worsted his own—the way to conquer. History
and Comparison—the twin lights of criticism, the only road-makers
across the abyss—are resorted to by him fearlessly.
That he loses the best of their light, and twists the road in the
wrong direction, by following Will-o'-the-wisps like his Virgil-worship,
matters in detail but not in principle. He has practically
come back to the safe way which Aristotle entered, but
was precluded from treading far enough, which Quintilian
and Longinus trod, but on which most of the ancients would
not set foot. He has not found the last secret—the secret of
<em>submitting</em> to History and to Comparison; he still looks upon
both as instruments to be used merely under the direction of,
and in subordination to, the purposes of <span lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span> theory. His
neglect of the vernaculars is not only wrong, but by his time
absurd. His minor prejudices (as against Erasmus) are sometimes
contemptible. His actual taste, as has been said, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>probably neither delicate nor versatile. But he has learning,
logic, lucidity within his range, laborious industry, and love
of literature. The multitude which followed him followed
him partly to do evil; but it would have been a surprise, and
almost a shame, had so bold and capable a leader lacked a
multitude of followers.</p>

<p class='c000'>As has been said, Lilius Giraldus also refers to Lodovico
Castelvetro, who at least resembled Scaliger in the characteristic
Ishmaelitism of the Renaissance critic. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Castelvetro.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> His quarrel
with Caro, also already referred to, was unluckily,
we must not say distinguished, but marked, by unfair play on
the part of his adversary, who “delated” him to the Inquisition
for heresy; and Castelvetro had to fly the country. His most
important work appeared late, the famous edition and translation,
with commentary, of the <cite>Poetics</cite><a id='r107'></a><a href='#f107' class='c019'><sup>[107]</sup></a> not being published till
a year before his death. “He was of his nature choleric,” says
his biographer; and he bestowed a good deal of this choler not
merely upon Caro, but upon the majestic Bembo and others.
Yet Castelvetro was a very remarkable critic, and perhaps
deserved the ascription of actual critical genius better than any
man who has yet been mentioned in this volume. It is but for
chequered righteousness that his practically certain formulation
of the Three Unities can be counted to him; but, as we
shall see, he has other claims, from which it is not necessary
to write off anything.</p>

<p class='c000'>His impartial attachment to both classical and vulgar tongues
ranks him, of itself, in a higher sphere than that of Scaliger;
and a certain impetuous, incalculable, <span lang="fr"><i>prime-sautier</i></span> genius puts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>him higher still. Even contemporaries seem to have recognised
this in him, though they sometimes shook their heads over its
pronouncements.<a id='r108'></a><a href='#f108' class='c019'><sup>[108]</sup></a> It may, indeed, sometimes seem that these
pronouncements are, if not inconsistent, difficult to connect by
any central tie-beam of critical theory. But this is almost
inevitable in the case of a critic whose work takes the form,
not of regular treatises on large subjects, nor even of connected
essays on separate authors and books, but of commentaries and
<span lang="de"><cite>adversaria</cite></span>, where the passage immediately under consideration
is uppermost in the writer’s mind, and may—not illegitimately
in a fashion—induce him to display a facet of his thought
which does not seem logically connected with other facets.
This peculiarity is perhaps the only excuse for the depreciation
of Dacier, who, reinforcing his native dulness with the superciliousness
of a Frenchman in the later years of Louis XIV.,
accused Castelvetro of ignorance, and even of contradiction of
Aristotle. The fact is, that Castelvetro is first of all an independent
critic, and that, though there are few less common,
there are no more valuable critical qualities than independence,
even when it is sometimes pushed to the verge of eccentricity,
providing only that it is sincere, and not ill-informed. It seems
to me uncharitable, if not flagrantly unjust, to deny Castelvetro
sincerity, and either impudent or ignorant to deny him
information.</p>

<p class='c000'>But he had also acuteness and taste. I do not know a better
example in little of the latter quality at the time than his short
and scornful description<a id='r109'></a><a href='#f109' class='c019'><sup>[109]</sup></a> of a preposterous comparison
by another critic, Bartolommeo Riccio, between
the “Sparrow” of Catullus and a pretty but commonplace
poem of Navagero on a dog. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Opere Varie.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> One may sigh over the
ruling passion, not to say the original sin, of critical man, on
passing from this to a tangle of recrimination and “that’s <em>my</em>
thunder” which follows with reference to Riccio and Pigna
and Cinthio. But this passes again into a solid discussion on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>the material and form of poetry, and on the office of the Muses.
Many of these animadversions are, as we should expect, purely
verbal, sometimes not beyond the powers of the <span lang="it"><i>grammaticuccio</i></span>,
of whom Castelvetro himself not unfrequently talks with piquant
scorn. But the comfort of finding annotations on Virgil alternating
with discourses on Dante, like that of placing a quarto
on Petrarch side by side with one on Aristotle, more than
atones for any occasional hair-splitting. We are at last in the
Jerusalem of general Literature which is the mother of us all,
which is free and universal; not in this or that separatist
Samaria or exclusive Hebron. The Platonic annotations,
which are numerous, are important, because they show just the
other side of Castelvetro’s talent from the merely verbal one—almost
the whole of them being devoted to the exposition and
illustration of meaning. It is a great pity that he did not
work his notes<a id='r110'></a><a href='#f110' class='c019'><sup>[110]</sup></a> on the <cite>Gorgias</cite> (which he regards expressly
as Plato’s <cite>Rhetoric</cite>) into a regular treatise of contrast and comparison
on this subject between Aristotle and Plato. But all
these notes show us the qualification of the commentator to
deal with so difficult a subject as the <cite>Poetics</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The stout post quarto, with its vignette of an exceedingly

hooting <em>Kekrika</em>, is dedicated to Maximilian II.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Poetica.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It is arranged on a system equally simple and
thorough. First comes a section of the Greek Text; then a
short Italian summary of its contents; then the Italian translation;
and then the <span lang="it"><i>spositione</i></span>—the Commentary—which may
be long or short as circumstances require. Often, on a Greek
text of a few lines, it will run to as many quarto pages, full-packed
with small print. Not the least advantageous part of
this quadripartite arrangement is that the summaries—being,
though very brief, to the point—are capable of being put together
as a table of contents. This, however, but partially
applies to Castelvetro’s commentary, which is often not a little
discursive from the text. The defect was, however, supplied
in the second edition by an elaborate index specially devoted
to the <span lang="it"><i>Spositioni</i></span>, and consisting, not of mere words or names
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>with page references, but of reasoned descriptions of the subjects,

or satellitic on another in general run, and yet branching and
winding with such a self-willed originality of its
own, is possible. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>On Dramatic conditions.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> One might easily write a folio on
Castelvetro’s quarto. Here we can only, as in most other cases
now, except those of books or parts of books at once epoch-making
in character and moderate in bulk, give an idea of the
author’s most important views on general and particular points.
It was necessary, since Castelvetro is revolving round Aristotle,
that the greater part of his treatise should deal with the drama:
and perhaps nowhere is that originality which has been praised
more visible than here, whether it lead him wrong or right.
He has undoubtedly made a step, from the mathematical
towards the æsthetic view of literature, in conditioning, as he
does, his view of the Drama by a consideration of the stage. To
literary <em>a-priorists</em> this is of course horrible; to those who take
the facts of literature, as they take the facts of life, it is a
welcome and reconciling discovery. The conditions of the
Greek stage were admittedly such as can never be naturally
reproduced, and therefore, however great and perfect the Greek
Tragedy may be in its own way, it cannot usurp the position of
“best in all ways”; and can still less pretend to dictate to
other kinds that they shall not be good at all in ways different
from its own.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the details of Castelvetro’s theory do not always correspond
in excellence to the sense and novelty of the general view,
this is because he adulterates his notion of stage
requirements with that unlucky “verisimilitude”
misunderstood, which is the curse of all the neo-classic critics,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>and which comes from neglect of the Aristotelian preference
of the probable-impossible to the improbable-possible.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>On the Three Unities.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The huge Mysteries of the Middle Ages, which ranged from
Heaven to Hell, which took weeks to act, and covered millennia
in their action, did at least this good to the English and some
other theatres—that they familiarised the mind with the neglect
of this verisimilitude. But Castelvetro would have none of
such neglect. His play must be adjusted, not merely in Action,
but in Space and Time, as nearly as possible to the actual
capacity of the stage, the actual duration of the performance.<a id='r111'></a><a href='#f111' class='c019'><sup>[111]</sup></a>
And so the Fatal Three, the Weird Sisters of dramatic criticism,
the vampires that sucked the blood out of nearly all European
tragedy, save in England and Spain, for three centuries, make
their appearance. They “enter the critical literature of
Europe,” as Mr Spingarn has very truly laid it down,<a id='r112'></a><a href='#f112' class='c019'><sup>[112]</sup></a> “from
the time of Castelvetro.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But to balance this enslaving of the Drama (in which he far
exceeds Aristotle), Castelvetro frees the Epic from Aristotelian
restrictions in an almost equally important manner.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>On the freedom of Epic.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> From his references in the <span lang="it"><cite>Opere Varie</cite></span> to Cinthio
and Pigna, it would appear that he claimed, if not
priority, an even portion with them in the consideration of the
subject of Epic Poetry. And though not agreeing with them
altogether, he certainly agrees with them in enlarging the
domains of the Epic. Poetry, he says in effect,<a id='r113'></a><a href='#f113' class='c019'><sup>[113]</sup></a> may do anything
that History can do; and, like the latter, it may deal, not
only with one action of one man, but with his life-actions, or
with many actions of many men.</p>

<p class='c000'>With Castelvetro, however,—and it is probably the cause why
pedants like Dacier undervalue him,—both the character of his
compositions, and probably also the character of his
mind, draw him much more to independent, though
by no means always or often isolated, critical <span lang="fr"><i>aperçus</i></span>
and judgments, than to theoretical discourses, with or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>without illustration. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His eccentric acuteness.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> To put it differently, while there is
usually a theory at the back of his appreciations, the appreciation
generally stands in front of the theory. But however this
may be, that quality of “unexpectedness,” in which some æsthetic
theorists have found such a charm, belongs to him as it
does to few critics. One might, for instance, give half-a-dozen
guesses to a tolerably ingenious person without his hitting on
Castelvetro’s objection to the story of Ricciardetto and Fiordispina
in the <span lang="it"><cite>Orlando</cite></span>.<a id='r114'></a><a href='#f114' class='c019'><sup>[114]</sup></a> That objection is not moral: not on the
ground of what is ordinarily called decorum: not on that of
digression, on that of improbability generally, on any other that
is likely to occur. It is, if you please, that as Fiordispina was a
Mahometan, and Ricciardetto a Christian, and as Christians and
Mahometans do not believe in the same kind of Fauns and
Fairies, as, further, Fauns do not eat ladies or goddesses, whether
alive or dead, Ricciardetto’s explanation of his alleged transformation
of sex is not credible. In a modern writer this would
look like an absolute absence of humour, or like a clumsy attempt
at it; and I am not prepared to say that humour was a
strong point with these Italian critics as a rule. But Castelvetro
strikes me as being by no means exceptionally unprovided with
it: and such a glaring lapse as this is probably due to the intense
seriousness with which these critical questions, new as
they were, presented themselves to him and to his class.</p>

<p class='c000'>They get, as was once said, “into logical coaches”; and are
perfectly content to be driven over no matter what minor precipices,
and into no matter what sloughs of despond, so long as
they are not actually thrown out. Yet Castelvetro at least is
never dull. At one time<a id='r115'></a><a href='#f115' class='c019'><sup>[115]</sup></a> he compares the “somnolent indecorum,”
the <span lang="it"><i>sconvenevolezza sonnachiosa</i></span>, of Homer to the practice
of German innkeepers (whether observed by himself in his
exile, or taken from Erasmus, one cannot say) in putting the
worst wines and viands on the table first, and the best later.
Elsewhere<a id='r116'></a><a href='#f116' class='c019'><sup>[116]</sup></a> he gives a very curious reason against that other
<span lang="it"><i>sconvenevolezza</i></span> (this sonorous word is a great favourite with
him) which he too saw in the use of prose for tragedy—namely,
that in reciting verse the speaker <em>naturally</em> raises his voice,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>and so makes it more audible to the audience. He has been
blamed for adopting the notion of rank being necessary to tragic
characters, but on this see <span lang="la"><i>ante</i></span> (p. <a href='#Page_61'>61</a>).</p>

<p class='c000'>His irreverent independence in regard to Virgil is noticeable
in a critic of his time, and of course especially so if one comes
<span class='sni side12'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Examples: Homer’s nodding, prose in tragedy, Virgil, minor poetry.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
to him straight from Scaliger. It would not be fair
to represent him as a “Virgiliomastix,” but his finer
critical sense enables him to perceive the superiority
of Homer, in respect of whom he goes so far<a id='r117'></a><a href='#f117' class='c019'><sup>[117]</sup></a> as to
say that Virgil “is not a poet.” But this—<span lang="la"><i>per se</i></span>, of
course, excessive—had been provoked by the extravagance
of Maronolatry from Vida downwards: and Castelvetro
does not scruple to praise the Mantuan for his grasp, his variety
of phrase, and other good things. He has an extremely sensible
passage—not novel to us, but by no means a truism to his contemporaries
or to a good many poets still—on what he who
publishes miscellaneous poetry has to expect. By the publication,
says this other Messer Lodovico, of a thing which nobody asked
him for (<span lang="it"><i>cosa non richiesta</i></span>) without any necessity, he publishes
at the same time his confidence in himself, and affirms that the
thing is good. “Which thing,” goes on Castelvetro in his pitiless
critical manner, “if it be found to be faulty (<span lang="it"><i>rea</i></span>) and blameworthy,
it convicts him who publishes it either of malice or of
folly.” Alas! for the minor bard.</p>

<p class='c000'>His attitude<a id='r118'></a><a href='#f118' class='c019'><sup>[118]</sup></a> to the everlastingly vexed question of the connection
of verse and poetry is very sensible, and practically
anticipates, with less reluctant circumlocution, that of
Coleridge, who in more things than one comes close
to Castelvetro, and who probably knew him. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The medium and end of Poetry.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He
does not here contradict Aristotle by denying that verse is un-<i>essential</i>
to poetry. But he insists—and points out the undoubted
truth that Aristotle’s practice, whatever his theory
may do, admits this—that Verse is a kind of inseparable accident
of poetry,—that it is the appropriate garb and uniform
thereof, which cannot be abandoned without impropriety. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>he takes up this attitude still more emphatically in regard to
the closely connected, and still more important, question of the
<em>end</em> of Poetry. Here, as we have seen, the great Master of
Criticism temporised. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Uncompromising championship of Delight.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He did not doubt that this end was
Delight: but in deference to idols, partly of the
Cavern, partly of the Market-place, he yokes and
hampers this end with moral improvement, with
Imitation, itself for itself, and so on. Castelvetro is
much more uncompromising. One shudders, almost as much
as one rejoices, at the audacity of a critic who in mid-sixteenth-century
calmly says, “What do beginning, middle, and
end matter in a poem, provided it delights?”<a id='r119'></a><a href='#f119' class='c019'><sup>[119]</sup></a> Nay, Castelvetro
has reached a point of view which has since been attained
by very few critics, and which some who thought they had
gained this peak in Darien first may be mildly chagrined to find
occupied by him—the view that there are different <em>qualities</em> of
poetry, suited to delight different qualities of persons and of mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>How seldom this view has been taken all critics ought to
know, if they do not. Even now he who climbs the peak
must lay his account with stone-throwing from the garrisons
of other points. That Burns administers, and has a right to
administer, one delight to one class of mind, Shelley another to
another; that Béranger is not to be denied the wine of poetry
because his vintage is not the vintage of Hugo: that Longfellow,
and Cowper, and George Herbert are not to be sneered
at because their delight is the delight of cheering but not of
intoxication; that Keble is not intrinsically the less a poet
because he is not Beddoes, or Charles Wesley because he is not
Charles Baudelaire—or <span lang="la"><i>vice versa</i></span> in all the cases—these are propositions
which not every critic—which perhaps not very many
critics—will admit even in the abstract, and which in practice
almost every critic falsifies and renounces at some time or other.<a id='r120'></a><a href='#f120' class='c019'><sup>[120]</sup></a>
But they are propositions which follow fairly, and indeed inevitably,
from Castelvetro’s theory of the necessary end, Delight,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>and the varying adjustment of the delighting agent to the
patient’s faculty of being delighted.</p>

<p class='c000'>He is perhaps less sound in his absolute condemnation of
“knowledge” as material for poetry. He is right in black-marking
Fracastoro from this point of view: but he is certainly
not right in extending the black mark to Lucretius.
The fact is, that even he could not wrench himself sufficiently free
from the trammels of old time to see that in the treatment lies
the faculty of delighting, and that therefore, on his own scheme,
the treatment is the poetry.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are few writers to be dealt with in this volume—none,
I think, already dealt with—to whom it would be more satisfactory
to devote the minutest handling than to
Castelvetro. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His exceptional interest and importance.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He has been called by Mr Spingarn
“revolutionary.” The term, in an American mouth,
probably has no unfavourable connotation; but
waiving that connotation altogether, I should be inclined to
demur to it. Even the <span lang="de"><cite>Vehmgericht</cite></span> (if one may rely on the
leading case of <i>Vgr.</i> v. <i>Philipson</i>, reported by Sir Walter Scott)
acquitted of High Treason those who had spoken evil of it in
countries where its authority was not acknowledged, and
indeed its name hardly known. Now, Castelvetro was dealing—as
we must, for his honour as well as for our comprehension of
him, remember that he dealt—with modern as well as with ancient
literature at once, and instead of adopting the injudicious
though natural separation of Minturno, or the one-sided treatment
of Scaliger, was constantly exploring, and always more or
less keeping in view, territories not merely in which Aristotle’s
writ did not run, but which in Aristotle’s time were No Man’s
Land and <span lang="la"><i>terra incognita</i></span>. He can no more be regarded as a
revolutionary or a rebel, in framing new laws for the new facts,
than a man could be regarded in either light for disregarding the
Curfew Law at the North Pole, or for disobeying sumptuary
regulations as to the use of woollen in the tropics. His <span lang="la"><i>ethos</i></span>
is really that of the self-reliant, resourceful, and adventurous
explorer, as he has been called—of the experimenter in new
material and under new conditions. That the paths he strikes
out sometimes lead to <span lang="fr"><i>culs-de-sac</i></span>—that the experiments he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>makes sometimes fail, is nothing more than is natural, than is
inevitable in the circumstances.</p>

<p class='c000'>More generally his value is great, and we may forgive him
(especially since he did <em>us</em> little or no harm) the binding of the
Unities on the necks of Frenchmen and Italians, in consideration
of the inestimable service which he did in standing up for
Epic—that is, Romantic—Unity of a different kind, and in formulating,
in a “No Surrender” fashion, the doctrine of Delight as
the Poetic Criterion. By doing this he not merely fought for
the freedom of the long narrative poem (which, as it happens,
has been a matter of minor importance, save at rare intervals,
since his time), but he unknowingly safeguarded the freedom
of the long narrative prose romance or novel, which was to be
the most important new contribution of modern times to literature.
Nor may it be amiss once more to draw attention to a
more general merit still, the inestimable <em>indifference</em> with which
he continually handles ancient and modern examples. Only by
this—the wisest “indifference of the wise”—can true criticism be
reached. It is an indifference which neglects no change of condition,
which takes count of all features and circumstances, but
which, for that very reason, declines to allow ancient literature
to prescribe unconditionally to modern, or modern to ancient, or
either to mediæval. As to this last, Castelvetro has, and could
be expected to have, nothing to say: as to the others, he is
more eloquent in practice than in express theory. But his
practice speaks his conviction, and it is the practice by which,
and by which alone, the serene temples of the really Higher
Criticism can be reached.</p>

<p class='c000'>The last third of the century provides only one author who
deserves (though he has seldom received) at least equal attention
with Scaliger and Castelvetro: but it has, like the
second, a crowd of minor critics who must not be
wholly passed over. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Tasso and the controversies over the</i> Gerusalemme.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Moreover, it boasts—if such
a thing be a subject of boasting—one equally
famous and weary controversy, that over the <span lang="it"><cite>Gerusalemme</cite></span>.
This, which expects the critical historian as its prey, and will
test his powers to the utmost if haply he may wrestle free of
it at once without inadequacy and without tedium, we may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>dare first: may take the interesting single figure of Patrizzi or
Patrici second, and then may sweep the rest into a conclusion,
which will itself leave not a little summarising to be done in
the Interchapter succeeding this Book.</p>

<p class='c000'>Torquato Tasso was, in more ways than one, fated to the ordeal
of controversy. His work would, in the already unfolded state
and temper of Italian criticism on the subject of the “heroic
poem,” have invited it in any case; but he had, in a manner,
inherited the adventure. His father, Bernardo, as has been
briefly recorded above, had himself taken much interest in
critical questions; and after being at first a classicist, had come
round to the position of Cinthio. It was Torquato’s object, by
argument and example alike, to reconcile the combatants. His
<span lang="it"><cite>Discorsi</cite></span> did not appear till late in 1587;<a id='r121'></a><a href='#f121' class='c019'><sup>[121]</sup></a> but they are said to
have been written some twenty years earlier, after the appearance
of Minturno’s Italian book. His plan is as simply obvious—shall
we say as obviously defective?—as that of the immortal
contributor to the <cite>Eatanswill Gazette</cite>. He, too, “combined his
information.” Some kind of Unity is to be imposed on the
Romantic Variety; and though this Unity cannot possibly be
the Aristotelian, it need not be quite such a different kind as
that of Castelvetro. It is to be organic, but may permit itself
the organs of a complex animal system.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor did Tasso stick to generalities; nor did he shrink from
giving hostages to fortune, and his enemies, by embodying his
ideas in practice. These ideas we have already seen floating in
various critical minds from Fracastorius to Castelvetro. The
“heroic poem”—for his theory and his example alike consecrated
that word for use, instead of either “epic” or “romance,”
for nearly two centuries—must not be pure invention, but
must avail itself of the authority of history. It must be
animated by religion, true religion—that is to say, Christianity.
It must have the supernatural. The hero must be a pious
and moral, if not necessarily faultless, character. It must not
be too dogmatic—that the poet may be free. It must deal with
ancient or modern history so as to be neither absolutely unfamiliar,
nor too familiar in its atmosphere and manners. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>persons, things, and scenes must be noble and stately. It will
probably strike every one that this is an admirable receipt for
a historical novel; and thus do we constantly find blind
strivings at things that cannot yet get themselves born. But
whether it is an equally good receipt for a poem may be
doubted. Some of us, at least, have no doubt that the <span lang="it"><cite>Gerusalemme</cite></span>,
which is faithfully constructed in accordance with it, is
not nearly so good a poem as the <span lang="it"><cite>Orlando</cite></span>, for the graceless graces
of which it was expressly devised to substitute something more
orderly and decent.</p>

<p class='c000'>The extensive and execrable controversy which followed did
not, however, turn wholly, though it very largely turned, on the
actual case of Ariosto <i>v.</i> Tasso. But, as usually happens, the
partisans of the latter provoked it by unadvised laudations of
him, and worse-advised attacks on his great predecessor. The
Florentines had not, as such, any special reason for championing
the “turnip-eating” Ariosto; but Tasso had offended the
coteries of the Della Crusca, and a Della Cruscan chief, the
Salviati already mentioned, took the field against the author of
the <span lang="it"><cite>Gerusalemme</cite></span>. He sallied forth in turn; and the bickering
became universal. Five mortal volumes of the standard edition
of Tasso appear to be occupied with an incomplete collection of
the documents on the subject—a collection which I have not
read and do not intend to read, but which whosoever rejoices
in such things may, if he likes, supplement with all the
<cite>Histories of Italian Literature</cite> from Tiraboschi downwards, and
all the Lives of Tasso, especially those of Serassi in the eighteenth
century and Solerti in the nineteenth.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most important upshot of the controversy is not itself in
dispute. The impregnable historical position of Cinthio was
strangely neglected by both sides (except by Ishmaelite outsiders
like Bruno and Patrizzi); nor was even the modified
Aristotelianism and “Unitarianism” of Castelvetro, as a rule,
attempted. Both sides swore fealty to Aristotle, and all debated
what Aristotle meant—what Unity was. And, in spite of the
exceptions, this was the condition in which the question was left
to the next century.</p>

<p class='c000'>The controversy, like that between Caro and Castelvetro,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>and (I fear it must be said) like literary controversies in general,
did not pass off without a muddying of the waters. Salviati,
Tasso’s chief adversary, and author of the dialogue <span lang="it"><cite>L’Infarinato</cite></span>
against him, had at first been a great admirer and almost
flatterer of the <span lang="it"><cite>Gerusalemme</cite></span>, had offered the author his friendship,
had praised his scheme, and had actually proposed to
celebrate it in that very commentary on the <cite>Poetics</cite> which Mr
Spingarn (who has read it in MS.) describes as actually devoted
to “undermining Tasso’s pretensions.” Exactly by what personal,
or cliquish, or patriotic offences he was induced to take
the opposite line, belongs to the obscure, dull, and disgusting
history of these literary squabbles generally, and we need not
concern ourselves with it. The points “for us” in the whole
matter are, first, that the controversy shows the strong hold
which a certain conception of criticism (whether the right one or
not) had obtained of the Italian mind; and, secondly, that the
main question on which it turned—“What <em>sort</em> of Unity heroic
poems must have?”—“In what manner must the precepts of
Aristotle be interpreted and adjusted?”—shows more than the
shadow of coming Neo-Classicism. The path of safety and
truth which Giraldi and Pigna had opened up many years
earlier, and which even Castelvetro, Unitarian as he was, had
been careful to leave open—the path starting, that is to say,
from the positions that Aristotle had not all literature before
him, and that the kinds of literature which he had not before
him could not, therefore, be subject to his dicta—was now
ignored or barred. <span lang="la"><i>Apparent diræ facies</i></span>, the faces of the
Unities, and there is nothing left to do, in the general opinion,
but to wrangle about their exact lineaments.</p>

<p class='c000'>The critical work of Tasso is far from inconsiderable, and
only a sense of duty prevents the consideration of it here at
greater length. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Tasso’s Critical writings</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It consists<a id='r122'></a><a href='#f122' class='c019'><sup>[122]</sup></a> of the <span lang="it"><cite>Discorsi</cite></span> which,
as noted above, appeared at Venice (with divers
<span lang="it"><cite>Lettere Poetiche</cite></span>) in one of the thin small parchment-covered
quartos for which the student of this literature begins,
after a time, to feel a distinct affection. The much longer and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>later <span lang="it"><cite>Discorsi del Poema Epico</cite></span> partly repeat, partly correct,
partly expand, the earlier work; and sometimes stand in a
curious relation to it.<a id='r123'></a><a href='#f123' class='c019'><sup>[123]</sup></a> But this by no means exhausts the
tale. Tasso, nothing if not conscientious, appears to have taken
his art in general, and his work in particular, very seriously
indeed. He makes extracts from Castelvetro; writes on the
Allegory of his own <span lang="it"><cite>Gerusalemme</cite></span>, an Apology for it in dialogue,
a formal Reply to the strictures of the Della Cruscans, a tractate
in answer to Patrizzi’s defence of Ariosto, another on Poetical
Differences, a long “Judgment of the <span lang="it"><cite>Conquistata</cite></span>,” a discourse
on the Art of the Dialogue. Also he has some curious considerations
on three Canzoni of Pigna’s entitled <span lang="it"><cite>Le Tre Sorelle</cite></span>,
written in honour of Lucrezia Bendidio, and dealing with Sacred
and Profane Love. These considerations have the additional
interest of being addressed to Leonora d’Este, and of breathing
a peculiar blend of that half-sensual, half-Platonic Renaissance
rapture of which the great <span lang="la"><i>locus</i></span> is the discourse assigned to
Bembo at the end of Castiglione’s <cite>Courtier</cite>, with the religiosity
which we more specially think of in Tasso. He has an
elaborate lecture on a single sonnet of La Casa,—a great
favourite of Tasso’s, and deservedly so as far as his serious
poetry goes,—and some minor matter of the kind.</p>

<p class='c000'>To the writing of this not inconsiderable <span lang="la"><i>corpus</i></span> of criticism
Tasso brought, besides his own genius and the interesting association
of his creative power, really wide reading,
and, as has been said, an indefatigable interest in
the subject. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>and position.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He exercised a good deal of influence in the time
to come—both Milton and Dryden, for instance (the latter
again and again), refer to his critical work. Yet it may perhaps
be said without presumption that this criticism is rather more
interesting to a student of Tasso, or to one who wishes to
obtain at famous hands some knowledge of the Italian sixteenth
century <span lang="la"><i>ethos</i></span> in this kind without going any further, than
to the student of criticism itself. Tasso is very fairly representative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>of it in its combination of Plato and Aristotle, in
its anxiety to get general notions of poetry and poetic kinds,
in its respect for the ancients, in its ethical turn. But he is
rather more representative than original or distinct; and his
criticism is not perhaps improved by the very natural fact
that sometimes avowedly, and probably in most cases really,
it is less a disinterested consideration of Poetry in general
than an apologetic of the poetry of Torquato Tasso. And as
that poetry itself, beautiful as it often is, is notoriously something
of a compromise between the Romantic and the Classical,
so the criticism which is connected with it is compromising
and compromised likewise. Tasso has many interesting observations,
intelligent <span lang="fr"><i>aperçus</i></span>, just remarks: he is a link, and
a very early link, in the apostolic succession of those who have
held and taught the great doctrine that poetry makes the
familiar unfamiliar, the accustomed strange and new.<a id='r124'></a><a href='#f124' class='c019'><sup>[124]</sup></a> But
he has not shaken himself free enough to gain the standpoint
of his friendly antagonist Patrizzi, and to recognise, even imperfectly,
that the secret of poetry is treatment <span lang="it"><i>poeticamente</i></span>,
and that only the historic method unfettered by rules will tell
you what <span lang="it"><i>poeticamente</i></span> has been and is, even thus leaving unknown
what it will be.</p>

<p class='c000'>At about the same time, however, a last, and the most
vigorous, if not altogether the best informed, attempt was made
to put the matter on this true historical basis. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Patrizzi: his</i> Poetica.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> A
year (1586) before the publication of Tasso’s
<span lang="it"><cite>Discorsi</cite></span>, and of his <span lang="it"><cite>Apologia</cite></span>, though long after the writing of
the first, and not without reference to himself and the dispute
between his partisans and those of Ariosto, there had been
printed at Ferrara, in two parts, one of the most important
and original of the numerous treatises which appeared during
this half-century or more, under the title of <span lang="it"><cite>Della Poetica</cite></span>. It
was the work of Francesco Patrizzi (as he is generally cited in
books, though both in the title-pages of this work, and in the
signature of his Dedication, it is spelt Patrici). The inspiration
of the book was, at least partly, due to the violent anti-Peripateticism
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>of which Patrizzi was at this time the twin
champion with Bruno;<a id='r125'></a><a href='#f125' class='c019'><sup>[125]</sup></a> and while we must no doubt thank
this party spirit for being in great part the cause of the volume,
there may be room for objecting that it somewhat obscures
the pure critical value of the treatises. That value, however,
remains great, and would be great even if there were nothing
in the book but an ill-carried-out idea. For its idea is the
basing of the inquiry into poetry, not on <span lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span> discussion of
the nature of the thing, and of its exponent the poet,—not on
previous authority as to these questions,—but on a historical
examination of extant poetical composition. It is, of course,
true that an examination of the kind was ready at hand in
Scaliger’s book. But nothing was further from Scaliger’s mind
than to <em>base</em> his inquiry on this: on the contrary, it comes late,
and is merely intended to supply illustration and texts for
verbal criticism.</p>

<p class='c000'>Patrizzi’s plan is quite different. His book consists of two
parts or “decades”—<span lang="it"><cite>La Deca Istoriale</cite></span> and <span lang="it"><cite>La Deca Disputata</cite></span>;
and though in some copies (my own is an instance) the cart
is perversely put before the horse, this is evidently a mere
stupidity of the binder, due to the fact that both books,
which are separately paged and title-paged, are of the same
year (1586), and perhaps to the other fact that the Dedication
of the <span lang="it"><cite>Disputata</cite></span> to Don Ferrando Gonzaga, Signor di
Guastalla, is dated, while that of the <span lang="it"><cite>Istoriale</cite></span> to Lucrezia
d’Este, Duchess of Urbino, is not. But the very first line of
the <span lang="it"><cite>Disputata</cite></span> makes references to the other as already done.</p>

<p class='c000'>That the “History of Poetry” of <span lang="it"><cite>il gran Patricio</cite></span>, as his
commendatory sonneteers love to call him, should
be either completely exhaustive or impeccably
methodical, it would be unreasonable to expect. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Deca Istoriale.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> There are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>indeed some surprising touches,<a id='r126'></a><a href='#f126' class='c019'><sup>[126]</sup></a> both of knowledge and of
liberality, in his admissions of the <span lang="it"><cite>Architrenius</cite></span> and the
<span lang="it"><cite>Anticlaudianus</cite></span>, of Marbod and Bede. But for the most
part he confines himself to classic and scriptural authors;
and his notices are rather those of a classical dictionary
maker, or hand-list man, than of a critical historian in the
best sense. Still, all things must have beginnings; and it is
a very great beginning indeed to find the actual documents
of the matter produced and arranged in any orderly fashion,
even if we do begin a little in the air with Giubale and
Giafeto, and end a little in the dark with Gaufredo and
Guntero.</p>

<p class='c000'>Only when he has spent 150 pages on this arrangement does
Patrizzi pass to his Second Book, in which (once more in the
true logical order) he arranges the productions of his poets in
<em>kinds</em>, of which he is a generous and careful distributor. The
much shorter Third deals with the kinds of verses; and the
Fourth with the festivals and spectacles at which poetry was
produced, the Fifth continuing this with special reference to
Games and Contests. The Sixth deals with the singing of
ancient poetry; the Seventh with its accompanying Music;
the Eighth with Rhythm; the Ninth with the Chorus; and
the Tenth with the persons who <em>produced</em> ancient poetry—rhapsodists,
priests, actors, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is, of course, to be observed that all this is strictly limited
to <em>Ancient</em> Poetry; indeed Patrizzi repeats the very words
religiously in the title of every Book. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Deca Disputata.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> To support
his examination with a further one of modern or
even Italian “vulgar” poetry does not seem to have occurred
to him. Perhaps, indeed—since he refers, as has been said, in
the very first line of his second part to <span lang="it"><i>la lunga e faticosa
istoria delle cose a poeti, a poemi, e a poetica spettanti</i></span> as <span lang="it">“condetta
a fine”</span> with a sort of sigh of relief—he may have thought
that his readers would not stand it. But it is noteworthy that
in this Decade he constantly cites Italian writers, and that the
last forty pages of his Tenth Book consist of a <span lang="it"><cite>Trimerone</cite></span> of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>controversy with Tasso himself, amicable (they were actually
friends), but by no means unanimated.</p>

<p class='c000'>The First Book of the <span lang="it"><cite>Disputata</cite></span> is given up to the cause
of poetry, which Patrizzi, again in accordance with Bruno,
decides to be Enthusiasm (<span lang="it"><cite>Furori</cite></span><a id='r127'></a><a href='#f127' class='c019'><sup>[127]</sup></a>), relying much on Plato,
especially on the Tynnichus passage (<i>v. supra</i>, vol. i. p. 20),
and even a little on Aristotle. The Second Book attacks,
with a good deal of acerbity, and some wire-drawing, but also
with learning, acuteness, and common-sense, the Aristotelian
doctrine of Imitation, and the philosopher’s order and distribution
of poetic kinds. The Third follows this up by
an inquiry whether, in a general way, Poetry is Imitation
at all; the Fourth by one whether the poet is an imitator.
And the conclusion of the three, enforced with great dialectical
skill, and with a real knowledge of Greek criticism,—that
of Plato, Longinus, and the Rhetoricians, as well as
Aristotle’s,—is that Poetry is <em>not</em> Imitation, or at any rate
that Imitation is not proper and peculiar to poets. In which
point it will go hard but any catholic student of literature,
however great his respect for Aristotle, must now “say ditto”
to Patrizzi.</p>

<p class='c000'>In his Fifth Book Patrizzi tackles a matter of far greater
importance—for after all the discussion, “Is Poetry Imitation, or
is it not?” is very mainly a logomachy. As Miss Edgeworth’s
philosophic boy remarks, “You may call your hat your cadwallader,”
when you have once explained that by this term you
mean “a black thing that you wear on your head.” But the
question of this Fifth Book, “Whether Poetry can be in prose?”
is of a very different kind. It goes, not to words but to things,
and to the very roots of them; it involves—if it may not be
said actually to <em>be</em>—the gravest, deepest, most vital question of
literary criticism itself; and on the answer given to it will turn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>the further answer which must be given to a whole crowd of
minor questions.</p>

<p class='c000'>On this point <span lang="it"><cite>il gran Patricio</cite></span> has at least this quality of
greatness, that he knows his own mind with perfect clearness,
and expounds it as clearly as he knows it. His conclusion<a id='r128'></a><a href='#f128' class='c019'><sup>[128]</sup></a> is,
“That verse is so proper and so essential to every manner of
poetry that, without verse, no composition either can or ought
to be Poetry.” This is refreshing, whether we consider that
Patrizzi has taken the best way of establishing his dogma or
not. He proceeds as usual by posing and examining the places—four
in number—in which Aristotle deals with the question;
and discusses them with proper exactness from the verbal point
of view, dwelling specially, as we should expect, on the term
ψιλὸς for prose. Then, as we should expect also, he enters into
a still longer examination of the very obscure and difficult
passage about the Mimes and the Socratic Dialogues. To say
that the argument is conducted in a manner wholly free from
quibbling and wire-drawing would perhaps be too much.
Patrizzi—and his logic is certainly not the worse for it—was
still in the habit of bringing things to directly syllogistic head
now and then; and of this modern readers are too often impatient.
But he does succeed in convicting Aristotle of using
language by no means wholly consistent; and he succeeds still
better in getting and keeping fast hold of that really final argument
which made De Quincey so angry when Whately so
forcibly put it<a id='r129'></a><a href='#f129' class='c019'><sup>[129]</sup></a>—the argument that from time immemorial
everybody, who has had no special point to prove, when
speaking of a poem has meant something in verse, that everybody,
with the same exception, has called things in verse poems.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our author’s acuteness is not less seen in the selection and
treatment of the subject of his Sixth Book, which is the intimately
allied question—indeed, the same question from another
point of view—“Whether the Fable rather than the verse makes
the property of the poem?” He is equally uncompromising
on this point; and has of course no difficulty in showing—against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>Plutarch rather than Aristotle—that “fable” in the
sense of “<em>made-up</em> subject” is not only not necessary to Poetry,
but does not exist in any of the most celebrated poems of the
most celebrated poets.<a id='r130'></a><a href='#f130' class='c019'><sup>[130]</sup></a> But he is not even yet satisfied in his
onslaught on the Four Places. He devotes a special Book (VII.—it
is true that all the constituents of this group of books are
short) to Aristotle’s contrast of Empedocles and Homer, labelling
the latter only as poet, the former as rather Physiologist. And
with this he takes the same course, convicting Aristotle, partly
out of his own mouth,<a id='r131'></a><a href='#f131' class='c019'><sup>[131]</sup></a> partly by citing the “clatter” (<span lang="it"><i>schiamaccio</i></span>)
which even his own commentators had made on this
subject. And, indeed, at the time even the stoutest Aristotelians
must have been puzzled to uphold a judgment which,
taken literally, would have excluded from the name of poetry
the adored <cite>Georgics</cite> of old, and the admired <cite>Syphilis</cite> of recent,
times.</p>

<p class='c000'>But, indefatigable as he is, he is still not “satiate with his
victory,” and in the Eighth Book attacks yet another facet of
the same great problem, “Whether Poetry can be based upon,
or formed from, History?” This was, as we have seen, a
question which had already interested the Italians much; and
Patrizzi in handling it draws nearer and nearer to his controversy
with Tasso, whom he here actually mentions. He has
little difficulty in showing that Aristotle’s contrast between
Poetry and History itself by no means denies historical subjects
to the poet, and that Aristotle is not at all responsible for, or
in accordance with, Plutarch’s extravagant insistence on “mendacity”
as a poetic <span lang="la"><i>proprium</i></span>. “All the materials comprised in
Art, or Science, or study,” says he<a id='r132'></a><a href='#f132' class='c019'><sup>[132]</sup></a> (in that manner of his
which we have already called refreshing, and which we shall
meet again seldom in this volume), “can be suitable subjects for
poetry and poems, <em>provided that they be poetically treated</em>.”
Verily, a <span lang="it"><i>gran Patricio</i></span>!</p>

<p class='c000'>The subject of the Ninth Book is less important and more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>purely antiquarian, but interesting enough. It discusses the
question whether ancient poetry necessarily involved “harmony”
and “rhythm,” and what these terms exactly mean—dancing
and gestic accompaniment being considered as well as
music. Patrizzi decides, sensibly enough on the historical comparison,
that all these things, though old and not unsuitable
companions of poetry, are in no sense formative or constitutive
parts of Poetry itself.<a id='r133'></a><a href='#f133' class='c019'><sup>[133]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The title-question of the Tenth Book is, “Whether the modes
of Imitation are three?” He discusses this generally, and
specially in regard to narrative and dramatic
delivery of the poetic matter, and then passes in an
appendix (which, however, he declares to be part of
the book) to the <span lang="it"><cite>Trimerone</cite></span> of reply to Tasso. <span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Trimerone <i>on Tasso</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> This is a necessarily
rather obscure summary, with some quotations, of a fuller
controversy between the two, complicated by glances at the
other literature of the <span lang="it"><cite>Gerusalemme</cite></span> quarrel, especially at the
work of Camillo Pellegrino.<a id='r134'></a><a href='#f134' class='c019'><sup>[134]</sup></a> To disentangle the spool, and
wind it in expository form, is out of the question here. Fortunately
the piece concludes with a tabular statement<a id='r135'></a><a href='#f135' class='c019'><sup>[135]</sup></a> of forty-three
opposition theses to Pellegrino and Tasso. A good many
of these turn on rather “pot-and-kettle” recriminations between
Homerists and Ariostians; but the general principles of comparative
criticism are fairly observed in them, and there is no
acerbity of language. In fact, although on some of the points
of the controversy Patrizzi took the Della Cruscan side, it does
not seem to have interrupted his friendship with Tasso, who
attended his lectures,<a id='r136'></a><a href='#f136' class='c019'><sup>[136]</sup></a> and whose funeral he attended.</p>

<p class='c000'>The intrinsic importance of Patrizzi’s criticism may be matter
of opinion; but it will hardly be denied that both its system
and its conclusions are widely different from those of nearly all
the Italian critics whom we have yet considered, though there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>may be approaches to both in Cinthio on the one hand and in
Castelvetro on the other. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Remarkable position of Patrizzi.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The bickering with Aristotle
on particular points is of much less importance
than the constant implicit, and not rare explicit,
reliance on the historic method—on the poets and the poems
that exist, the ideas of poetry conveyed by common parlance,
the body of the written Word in short, and not the letter of the
written Rule. I am not sure that Patrizzi ever lays down the
doctrine that “Rules follow practice, not practice rules,” with
quite the distinctness of Bruno in the passage cited above.<a id='r137'></a><a href='#f137' class='c019'><sup>[137]</sup></a>
But he makes a fight for it in a passage of the <span lang="it"><cite>Trimerone</cite></span>,<a id='r138'></a><a href='#f138' class='c019'><sup>[138]</sup></a> and
his entire critical method involves it more or less. If he does
not quote modern literature much, it is obviously because the
controversy in which he was mixing took its documents and
texts mainly from the ancients; but he is so well acquainted with
the modern literature, not merely of his own language, that he
actually cites<a id='r139'></a><a href='#f139' class='c019'><sup>[139]</sup></a> Claude Fauchet’s <span lang="fr"><cite>Origines de la Poésie Française</cite></span>,
which had appeared in 1581. That his interest in the whole
matter may have been philosophical rather than strictly, or at
least exclusively, literary is very possible—he was actually a
Professor of Philosophy; but however this may be, he has
hit on the solid causeway under the floods, and has held his
way steadily along it for as far as he chose to go. Nay, in
the sentence which has been chosen for the epigraph of this
Book, he has kept it open for all to the end of Poetry and
of Time.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are, however, few propositions in literature truer than
this—that it is of no present use to be wise for the future. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Sed contra mundum.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> If
a man chooses the wisdom of the morrow, he must
be content for the morrow to appreciate him—which
it does not always, though no one but a poor creature will
trouble himself much about that. Patrizzi had a really considerable
reputation, and deserved it; but in matters literary he
was two hundred years in front of his time, and his time avenged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>itself by taking little practical notice of him.<a id='r140'></a><a href='#f140' class='c019'><sup>[140]</sup></a> The critical
writers of the last fifteen or twenty years of the century are
fairly numerous; and though none of them can pretend to great
importance, the names of some have survived, and the writings
of some of these are worth examination, certainly by the historian
and perhaps by the student. But the general drift of
them is usually anti-Patrician and pro-Aristotelian, in that
very decidedly sophisticated interpretation of Aristotle which
was settling itself down upon the world as critical orthodoxy.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The latest group of sixteenth-century Critics.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Among them we may mention one or two which,
though actually earlier than Patrizzi, are later than
Castelvetro, and will help to complete, as far as we
can here attempt it, the conspectus of that remarkable
flourishing time of Italian critical inquiry which actually
founded, and very nearly finished, the edifice of European
criticism generally for three centuries at least. The authors
to whom we return are Partenio, Viperano, Piccolomini, Gilio
da Fabriano, and Mazzoni; those to whom we proceed are
Jason Denores, Gabriele Zinano, and Faustino Summo. This
latter, who, with an odd coincidence of name, date, and purport,
does really sum up the sixteenth century for Aristotle, and so
govern the decisions of the seventeenth and eighteenth, had
been immediately preceded in the same sense by Buonamici,<a id='r141'></a><a href='#f141' class='c019'><sup>[141]</sup></a>
Ingegneri,<a id='r142'></a><a href='#f142' class='c019'><sup>[142]</sup></a> and others.</p>

<p class='c000'>Partenio, like Minturno and some others, gave his thoughts
on the subject to the world in both “vulgar” and “regular”;<a id='r143'></a><a href='#f143' class='c019'><sup>[143]</sup></a>
<span class='sni side6'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span lang="it"><cite>Partenio.</cite></span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
but the two forms, while not identical, are closer
together than is sometimes the case, though there is
in the Latin a curious appended anthology of translation and
parallel in the two languages. He is rather a formal person (as
indeed may be judged from his particular addiction to Hermogenes
as an authority), but he is not destitute of wits. Throughout
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>he quotes Italian as well as Latin examples, and refers to
Italian critics such as Trissino; while in one place he gives
something like a regular survey of contemporary Latin poetry
by Italians from Pontanus to Cotta. He lays special stress on
the importance of poetic diction; he thinks that Art can and
should improve nature; but he is as classical as the stiffest
<span lang="fr"><i>perruque</i></span> of the French anti-Romantic school in believing Aristotle
and Horace to contain everything necessary to poetical
salvation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Viperano.</i></div>

<p class='c000'>Viperano<a id='r144'></a><a href='#f144' class='c019'><sup>[144]</sup></a> (who by a natural error is sometimes cited as
Vi<em>tu</em>perano) somewhere makes the half-admission, half-boast,
<span lang="la"><i>scripsimus autem varios libros de variis rebus</i></span>, and
is indeed a sort of rhetorical bookmaker who oscillates
between instruction and epideictic. This character is
sufficiently reflected in his <span lang="la"><cite>De Arte Poetica</cite></span>. He had some
influence—even as far as Spain (<i>v. inf.</i>)</p>

<p class='c000'>Piccolomini’s book,<a id='r145'></a><a href='#f145' class='c019'><sup>[145]</sup></a> which is a compact small quarto of 422
pages, differs in arrangement from Castelvetro’s merely in not
giving the Greek—the <span lang="it"><i>particelle</i></span> of the original in
translation being followed by solid blocks of <span lang="it"><i>annotationi</i></span>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Piccolomini.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The author was of that well-known type of Renaissance
scholar which aspired to a generous if perhaps impossible
universalism; and as he puts this encyclopædic information at
the service of his notes, they are naturally things not easily to
be given account of in any small space, or with definite reference
to a particular subject. That Piccolomini, however, was not
destitute of acuteness or judgment to back his learning, reference
to test passages will very easily show. He has not allowed
the possible force of the μᾶλλον, for instance, to escape him in
the Homer-and-Empedocles passage referred to a little earlier—indeed
Maggi had put him in the right way here. But, in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>and other cases, he is somewhat too fond of “hedging.” “We
must remember this; but we must not forget that,” &#38;c. The inspiriting
downrightness of Scaliger on the one side, and Patrizzi
on the other, is not in him; and we see the approach, in this
subject also, of a time of mere piling up of authorities, and marshalling
of arguments <em>pro</em> and <em>con</em>, to the darkening rather than
the illumination of judgment.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <span lang="it"><cite>Topica Poetica</cite></span> of Giovanni Andrea Gilio da Fabriano<a id='r146'></a><a href='#f146' class='c019'><sup>[146]</sup></a>
comes well next to Piccolomini, because the pair are characteristic
examples of the two parallel lines in which, as
we have seen throughout, Italian criticism proceeds
during the century. <span class='sni side4'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Gilio.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In plan it presents no inconsiderable resemblance
to that work of our own Puttenham (<i>v. infra</i>) which
followed it at no great interval; but it is, as its special title will
have indicated to the expert, even more definitely rhetorical.
In fact, it must be one of the very latest treatises in which, on
the partial precedent of antiquity, Poetics are brought <em>directly</em>
under Rhetoric. We actually start with accounts, illustrated
by poetical examples in the vernacular, of the Deliberative,
Demonstrative, and Judicial kinds; we pass thence to Invention,
Imitation, and Style; and thence again to Decorum, the
Proper, and so forth, all still illustrated from the vulgar tongue
mainly, but with a Latin example here and there. And this
finishes the short First Book. The longer Second is the most
strictly “topical,” with its sections (at first sight bewildering to
the modern non-expert mind) on Definition and Etymology, on
Genus and Species, on Example and Induction, on Proceeding
from Less to Greater and from Greater to Less, on Amplification,
Authority, Custom, and Love. The Third is wholly on
Figures of Speech, and the Fourth on Tropes or Figures of
“Conceit.” The poetical illustration is all-pervading, and there
is an odd appendix of sonnets from ladies of Petrarch’s time.
The book is chiefly worth notice here because, as has been said,
it is one of the latest—perhaps, with the exception of Puttenham’s
own, the actually latest—of its special subdivision that
we shall have to notice,—the subdivision, that is to say, in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>the literature handled is absolutely subordinate to an artificial
system of classification, in which the stamped and registered
ticket is everything, so that, when the critic has tied it on, his
task is done.</p>

<p class='c000'>Giacomo Mazzoni is perhaps better known<a id='r147'></a><a href='#f147' class='c019'><sup>[147]</sup></a> than at least some
of the subjects of this chapter, owing to his connection with
<span class='sni side4'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Mazzoni.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Dante. He first, in 1573, published at Cesena a
brief <span lang="it"><cite>Difesa di Dante</cite></span> of some fifty folios, in fairly
large print, and followed it up fourteen years later with an
immense <span lang="it"><cite>Della Difesa</cite></span>, containing 750 pages of very small print
without the index. The points of the actual <span lang="it"><cite>Difesa</cite></span> are not uncurious—such
as an argument that discourses on Poetry are not
improper for the philosopher, and that Dante is a particularly
philosophical poet, in fact encyclopædic. From the Imitation
point of view the Comedy can be easily defended, as it is a real
following of action, and not the mere relation of a dream: and
as dealing with <em>costume</em> (manners) it is a comedy, not a tragedy
or heroic poem. The <span lang="it"><cite>Della Difesa</cite></span>, on the other hand, is a
wilderness of erudition and controversy, arranged under abstract
heads (“how the poets have conducted themselves towards
the predicaments of Time and Place,” &#38;c.), and diverging into
inquiries and sub-inquiries of the most intricate character—the
trustworthiness of dreams,<a id='r148'></a><a href='#f148' class='c019'><sup>[148]</sup></a> the opinions held of them in antiquity,
the nature and kinds of allegory, Dante’s orthodoxy—in
short, all things Dantean, and very many others. If I cannot
with Mr Spingarn<a id='r149'></a><a href='#f149' class='c019'><sup>[149]</sup></a> discover “a whole new theory of poetry” in

<p class='c000'>The <span lang="it"><cite>Poetica</cite></span> of Jason Denores<a id='r150'></a><a href='#f150' class='c019'><sup>[150]</sup></a> is remarkable from one point
of view for its thoroughgoing and “charcoal-burner” Aristotelianism,
from another for the extraordinary and meticulous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>precision of its typographical arrangements. How many sizes
and kinds of type there are in Jason’s book I am
<span class='sni side4'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Denores.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
not enough of an expert in printing to attempt to
say exactly: and the arrangement of his page is as precious as
the selection of his type. Sometimes his text overflows the
opened sheet, with decent margins indeed but according to
ordinary proportions; at others (and by no means always because
he requires side-notes) it is contracted to a canal down
the centre, with banks broader than itself. It is, however, when
Denores comes to the tabular arrangement and subdivision of
statement and argument, in which nearly all these writers
delight, that he becomes most eccentric. As many divisions,
so many parallel columns; under no circumstances will his
rigid equity give one section the advantage of appearing on the
<span lang="la"><i>recto</i></span> of a leaf while the others are banished to the <span lang="la"><i>verso</i></span>. This
is all very well when the divisions are two or three or even four.
But when, as sometimes happens, there are six or even eight,
the cross-reading of the parallel columns is at once tempting
and conducive to madness. As each column is but some half-inch
broad, almost every word longer than a monosyllable has
to be broken into, and as only a single <i>em</i> of space is allowed
between the columns, there is a strong temptation to “follow
the line.” By doing this you get such bewilderments as</p>

<p class='c008'>a moderate dose of which should suffice to drive a person of
some imagination, and excessive nerves, to Bedlam. Read
straight, however, Denores is much more sedative, not to say
soporific, than exciting: and his dealings with Tragedy, the
Heroic Poem, and Comedy have scarcely any other interest
than as symptoms of that determination towards unqualified, if
not wholly unadulterated, Aristotelianism which has been remarked
upon.</p>

<p class='c000'><span lang="it"><cite>Il Sogno, overo della Poesia</cite></span>, by Gabriele Zinano,<a id='r151'></a><a href='#f151' class='c019'><sup>[151]</sup></a> dedicated at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Reggio on the 15th October 1590 to the above-mentioned
Ferrando Gonzaga of Guastalla, is a very tiny treatise,
<span class='sni side4'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Zinano.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
written with much pomp of style, but apparently
unnoticed by most of the authorities on the subject. The
author had studied Patrizzi (or Patrici, as he, too, calls him),
and was troubled in his mind about Imitation, and about the
equivocal position of Empedocles. He comforts himself as he
goes on, and at last comes to a sort of eclectic opportunism,
which extols the instruction <em>and</em> delight of poetry, admits
that it can practically take in all arts and sciences, but will not
admit fable as making it without verse, or verse without fable,
and denies that both, even together, make it necessarily good.
The little piece may deserve mention for its rarity, and yet
once more, as symptomatic of the hold which critical discussion
had got of the Italian mind, Zinano is evidently full of the
<span lang="it"><cite>Deca Istoriale</cite></span> and the <span lang="it"><cite>Deca Disputata</cite></span>, but alarmed at their
heresies.</p>

is a sort of “Bysshe” <span lang="la"><i>ante Bysshium</i></span>—a huge <span lang="la"><i>gradus</i></span> of poetic
tags from Virgil, Ovid, and Horace, arranged ready for anybody
who wishes to pursue the art of poetry according to the principles
of Vida. Here you may find choice of phrases to express
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>the ideas of “going to bed for the purpose of sleeping,” of
“black and beautiful eyes,” of “shoes that hurt the feet,” and
of “horses that run rapidly.” It was inevitable that this
manual at once and <span lang="la"><i>reductio ad absurdum</i></span> of the mechanic Art
of Poetical Imitation should come—indeed, others had preceded
Mazzone, for instance Fabricius, in Germany (see next Book).

it came.</p>

the meaning of the word <span lang="it"><i>philanthropia</i></span>;<a id='r156'></a><a href='#f156' class='c019'><sup>[156]</sup></a> the last
words (the purgation clause) of the Definition

of atrocities and deaths; the admissibility of true
fables; the necessity of unity of action; the propriety of drama
in prose; <span lang="la"><i>furor poeticus</i></span>; the sufficiency of verse to make
poetry; the legitimacy of tragi-comedy and pastoral; and the
quality of the <span lang="it"><cite>Pastor Fido</cite></span>. Summo gives us our last word here
with singular propriety. He is not quite Aristotelian to the
point of infallibility, and his orthodoxy is what may be called a
learned orthodoxy—that is to say, he is careful to quote comments
or arguments of many of the writers whom we have
mentioned in this chapter and the last, from Trissino to
Denores, and of a few whom we have not. But in him this
orthodoxy is in the main <em>constituted</em>: it is out of the stage of
formation and struggle; and it is ready—all the more so that
many of its documents have already passed with authority to
other countries and languages—to take its place as the creed
of Europe.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f97'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r97'>97</a>. My copy is the second edition (apud Petrum Santandreanum, <i>s. l.</i>, 1581).</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f98'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r98'>98</a>. This joke requires a little explanation
and adaptation to get it into
English. The Latin is <span lang="la"><i>miror majores

<span lang="la"><i>circumscribere</i></span>. In fact, <em>Fattojo</em> and
<em>Fattojano</em>, if not <em>fattore</em>, do mean in
Italian “Oil-Press” and “Oil-Presser.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f99'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r99'>99</a>. Scaliger goes so far as to say that
“it would be better never to have
read” the <cite>Symposium</cite> and the <cite>Phædrus</cite>,
because of their taint with the <span lang="la"><cite>Grœcanicum
scelus</cite></span>.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f100'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r100'>100</a>. The decision of this is all the more
remarkable that Scaliger does not, as
unwary moderns might expect, make
verse the <em>form</em> of Poetry, but the
<em>matter</em>.  Feet, rhythm, metre, these are
the things that Poetry works in, her
stuff, her raw material.  The skill of
the poet in its various applications
is the form.  A very little thought
will show this to be the most decisive
negation possible of the Wordsworthian
heresy—anticipated by many sixteenth-century
writers, from Italy to England,
and though not exactly authorised,
countenanced by the ancients,
from Aristotle downwards—that verse
is <em>not</em> essential in any way.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f101'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r101'>101</a>. One cannot help thinking that this
distinction, which is quite contrary to
those entertained by Aristotle and
Quintilian, must have been influenced
by the cadences of the modern languages—Italian
and French—with which
Scaliger was familiar. In both, but
especially in French, the actual “measuring-off”
of syllables was the be-all
and end-all of metre, the easements
provided in English and German by
syllabic equivalence being in French
refused altogether, in Italian replaced
only by the more meagre aid of syncope
and apocope.</p>

Besides these he wrote an “exposition”

never tired of reading, and discovering
new beauties in, Boccaccio. Bentley,

Castelvetro against Boyle, says that
“his books have at this present time
such a mighty reputation, that they
are sold for their weight in silver in
most countries of Europe.” I am glad
that this is not true now, for the

<p class='c004'>There is, perhaps, no more remarkable proof of the extraordinarily
germinal character of Italian literature than the
influence which it exercised on France in the department
with which we here deal. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Rhetorics <i>of the Transition</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It is needless
to say that the subsequent story of French literature
has shown how deep and wide is the critical vein in the French
literary spirit. But up to the middle of the sixteenth century
this vein was almost absolutely <span lang="la"><i>irrepertum</i></span>—whether <span lang="la"><i>sic melius
situm</i></span> or not. A few <em>Arts</em> of Poetry and Rhetoric had indeed
been introduced across the Channel long before we had any on
this side, as we should expect in a language so much more
advanced than English, and as we have partly seen in the preceding
volume. The <span lang="fr"><cite>Art de dittier</cite></span> of Eustache Deschamps, at
the end of the fourteenth century, had been followed<a id='r157'></a><a href='#f157' class='c019'><sup>[157]</sup></a> throughout
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>the fifteenth by others, some of them bearing the not
uninteresting or unimportant title of “<span lang="fr"><cite>Seconde Rhétorique</cite></span>,” as
distinguishing Poetics from the Art of Oratory. The chief of
these,<a id='r158'></a><a href='#f158' class='c019'><sup>[158]</sup></a> almost exactly a century later than the treatise of
Deschamps, used to be assigned to Henri de Croy, and is now
(very likely with no more reason) handed over to Molinet.
But they were almost entirely, if not entirely, occupied with
the intricacies of the “forms” of <span lang="fr"><i>ballade</i></span>, &#38;c., and included no
criticism properly so called.</p>

<p class='c000'>The spirit and substance of these treatises seems to have been
caught up and embodied, about the year 1500, in another Rhetoric,<a id='r159'></a><a href='#f159' class='c019'><sup>[159]</sup></a>
which became very popular, and was known by such titles
as the “Flower” or “Garden of Rhetoric,” but the author of
which is only known by one of those agreeably conceited <span lang="fr"><i>noms
de guerre</i></span> so frequent at the time, as “<span lang="fr">‘l’Infortunaté’</span>” Its
matter appeared, without much alteration or real extension, in
the works of Pierre Fabri<a id='r160'></a><a href='#f160' class='c019'><sup>[160]</sup></a> and Gratien du Pont (1539),<a id='r161'></a><a href='#f161' class='c019'><sup>[161]</sup></a> and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>actual birth of French criticism proper is postponed, by most if
not all historians, till the fifth decade of the century, when
Pelletier translated the <span lang="la"><cite>Ars Poetica</cite></span> of Horace in 1545, while
Sibilet wrote an original <span lang="fr"><cite>Art Poétique</cite></span> three years later, and
just before Du Bellay’s epoch-making <span lang="fr"><cite>Défense</cite></span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is little possibility of difference of opinion as to the
striking critical moment presented to us by the juxtaposition,
<span class='sni side4'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Sibilet.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
with but a single twelvemonth between, of Sibilet and
Du Bellay. The importance of this movement is
increased, not lessened, by the fact that Sibilet himself is by no
means such a copyist of Gratien du Pont as Du Pont is of Fabri,
and Fabri of the unknown “Unfortunate,” and the “Unfortunate”
of all his predecessors to Deschamps. He does
repeat the lessons of the <cite>Rhetorics</cite> as to verse and rhyme, and so
forth. He has no doubt about the excellence of that “equivocal”
rhyme to which France yet clings, though it has always
been unpleasing to an English ear. And (though with an indication
that they are passing out of fashion) he admits the most
labyrinthine intricacies of the ballade and its group.<a id='r162'></a><a href='#f162' class='c019'><sup>[162]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>But he is far indeed from stopping here. He was (and small
blame to him) a great admirer of Marot, and he had already
learnt to distrust that outrageous “aureation” of French with
Greek and Latin words which the <span lang="fr"><i>rhétoriqueurs</i></span> had begun,
which the intermediate school of Scève and Heroet were continuing,<a id='r163'></a><a href='#f163' class='c019'><sup>[163]</sup></a>
and which the <span lang="fr"><cite>Pléiade</cite></span>, though with an atoning touch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>of elegance and indeed of poetry, was to maintain and increase,
in the very act of breaking with other <span lang="fr"><i>rhétoriqueur</i></span> traditions.
He delights in Marot’s own epigrams, and in the sonnets of
Mellin de Saint-Gelais; and he is said to have anticipated Ronsard
in the adoption of the term “ode” in French, though his
odes are not in the least Pindaric (as for the matter of that
Ronsard’s are not). The epistle and the elegy give fresh intimation
of his independent following of the classics, and he pays particular
attention to the eclogue, dwells on the importance of the
“version” (translation from Greek or Latin into French verse),
and in the opening of his book is not very far from that half-Platonic,
half anti-Platonic, deification of Poetry which is the
catch-cry of the true Renaissance critic everywhere. There is
not very much real, and probably still less intentional, innovation
or revolt in Sibilet; and it is precisely this that makes him
so valuable. Fabri and Gratien du Pont are merely of the old:
in no important way do the form and pressure of the coming
time set their mark on them. Du Bellay is wholly of the new:
he is its champion and crusader, full of scorn for the old.
Sibilet, between them, shows, uncontentiously, the amount of
leaning towards sometimes revised or exotic novelty, and away
from immediate and domestic antiquity, which influenced the
generation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The position of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Défense et Illustration de la Langue Française</cite></span>
may be said to be in the main assured and uncontested, nor
do I think it necessary to make such a curious dictum
as that it is “not in any true sense a work of
literary criticism at all” the subject of much counter-argument.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Du Bellay.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In that case most undoubtedly the <span lang="fr"><cite>De Vulgari Eloquio</cite></span>, of which
it has been not much less strangely held to be little more than
a version adapted to the latitude of Paris, is not such a work
either. I think it very likely that Du Bellay knew the <span lang="fr"><cite>De
Vulgari</cite></span>, which Trissino had long before published in Italian;
but both the circumstances and the purpose of the two books
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>seem to me as entirely different as their position in literary
criticism seems to me absolutely secure.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whether this be so or not, Du Bellay’s circumstances are perfectly
well known, and his purpose is sun-clear, alike before him
and before his readers. <span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> <span lang="fr">Défense et Illustration de la Langue Française.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He is justifying the vulgar
tongue,<a id='r164'></a><a href='#f164' class='c019'><sup>[164]</sup></a> but he is justifying it as Ascham and his
friends were doing in England; with the proviso
that it shall be reformed upon, strengthened by, and
altogether put to school to, the classical languages
in the first place, with in the second (and here Ascham would
<em>not</em> have agreed) Italian and even Spanish. His dealing is
no doubt titularly and ostensibly directed to the language;
but his anxieties are wholly concentrated on the language <em>as
the organ of literature</em>—and specially of poetry. That he made
a mistake in turning his back, with the scorn he shows, on the
older language itself, and even on the verse-forms which had
so long occupied it, is perfectly true. This is the besetting
sin of the Renaissance—its special form of that general sin
which, as we said at the outset, doth so easily beset every
age. But his scheme for the improvement is far more original;
and, except in so far as it may have been faintly suggested by a
passage of Quintilian,<a id='r165'></a><a href='#f165' class='c019'><sup>[165]</sup></a> had not, so far as I know, been anticipated
by any one in ancient or modern times. Unlike Sibilet, and
unlike preceding writers generally, he did not believe so very
much in translation—seeing justly that by it you get the
matter, but nothing, or at least not much, more.<a id='r166'></a><a href='#f166' class='c019'><sup>[166]</sup></a> He
did not believe in the mere “imitation” of the ancients
either. I cannot but think that M. Brunetière<a id='r167'></a><a href='#f167' class='c019'><sup>[167]</sup></a> has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>rather unjust in upbraiding Du Bellay with the use of this
word. He does use it: but he explains it. He wishes the
ancients to be imitated in their processes, not merely in their
results. His is no Ciceronianism; no “Bembism”; none of
that frank advice to “convey” which Vida had given before
him, and to which, unluckily, his master Ronsard condescended
later. “How,” he asks, “did Greek and Latin become such
great literary languages?” Were they always so? Not at
all. It was due to culture, to care, to (in the case of Latin
at least) ingenious grafting of fresh branches from Greek.
So is French to graft from Greek, from Latin, from Italian,
from Spanish even—so is the essence of the classics and the
other tongues to be converted into the blood and nourishment
of French.<a id='r168'></a><a href='#f168' class='c019'><sup>[168]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Is this “not in any pure sense literary criticism at all”? Is
this “young” and “pedantic” and “too much praised” by (of
<span class='sni side12'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Its positive gospel and the value thereof.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
all Sauls among the prophets!) Désiré Nisard? I
have a great respect for Mr Spingarn’s erudition; I
have a greater for M. Brunetière’s masterly insight
and grasp in criticism; but here I throw down the
glove to both. That Du Bellay was absolutely wrong in his
scorn for <span lang="fr"><i>ballade</i></span> and <span lang="fr"><i>rondeau</i></span> and other “<span lang="fr"><i>épiceries</i></span>” I am sure;
that his master was right in looking at least as much to the old
French lexicon as to new constructions or adoptions I am sure.
But Du Bellay (half or all unawares, as is the wont of finders
and founders) has seized a secret of criticism which is of the
most precious, and which—with all politeness be it spoken—I
venture to think that M. Brunetière himself rather acknowledges
and trembles at, than really ignores. This free trade in
language, in forms, in processes,—this resolute determination
to convert all the treasures of antiquity and modernity alike
into “food” for the literary organism, “blood” for the literary
veins, marrow for the literary bones,—is no small thing. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>may not be the absolute and sole secret of literary greatness.
But we can almost see that Greek, the most perfectly literary
of all languages for a time, withered and dwindled because
it did not pursue this course; that Latin followed it on too
small a scale; above all, that English owes great part of its
strength, and life, and splendid flourishing of centuries, to it.
Du Bellay preached, perhaps more or less unconsciously, what
Shakespeare practised—whether consciously or unconsciously
we need neither know nor care, any more than in all probability
he knew or cared himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>No doubt all languages and all literatures have not the
digestive strength required to swallow poison and food, bread
and stones, almost indiscriminately, assimilating all the good, and
dismissing most if not all of the evil. There are not, and never
have been in England, wanting people, from the towering head
of Swift down to quite creeping things of our own time, who have
been distressed by “mob” and by “bamboozle,” by “velleity”
and by “meticulous.” No doubt in France the objection has
been still greater, and perhaps better founded on reason. But
these propositions will not affect, in the slightest degree, the
other proposition that Du Bellay, in the <span lang="fr"><cite>Défense</cite></span>, stumbled upon,
and perhaps even half-consciously realised, that view of literature,
and of language as the instrument of literature, which
will have the whole to be mainly <span lang="fr"><i>un grand peut-être</i></span>—a vast
and endless series of explorations in unknown seas, rather than
a mathematical or chemical process of compounding definite
formulas and prescriptions, so as to reach results antecedently
certain. Very far would it have been from Nisard, who was
no doubt bribed by the militant classicism of the Pléiade, to
have given his praise had he thought this: I am even prepared
to admit that Du Bellay himself would probably not have
thanked me for the compliment of my theory. But hatred
is often more sagacious than friendship. Malherbe and those
about Malherbe knew perfectly well what the real spirit of
the Pléiade was. And so does M. Brunetière, who has a scent
as keen as that of Malherbe and those about Malherbe, and is
very much better read, very much more scientifically equipped,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>and quite infinitely better provided with intellectual and critical
gift.<a id='r169'></a><a href='#f169' class='c019'><sup>[169]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It was unlikely, or rather impossible, that so revolutionary
a challenge should lack its answer, which duly appeared a year
later under the odd title of <span lang="it"><cite>Le Quintil Horatien</cite></span>.<a id='r170'></a><a href='#f170' class='c019'><sup>[170]</sup></a>
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Quintil Horatien.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> This used to be attributed to Charles Fontaine, a
poet of parts; but it seems that he repudiated it, and it is now
handed over to a pedagogue of the name of Aneau. It is a
dogged little book, which treats the <span lang="it"><cite>Défense</cite></span> very much as if it
were an impertinent school exercise, and goes through it with
the lead pencil in a fashion at once laborious, ineffectual, and
suggestive of a vain desire to substitute the birch rod. The
author, whoever he was, might have found plenty of things
to say against Du Bellay, and he is on fairly solid ground
when he indignantly protests that William of Lorris, Chartier,
Villon, and others were not the artless clowns, or positive
sinners, that this petulant-sparkling star of the Pléiade had
looked awry upon. But even here his own ignorance of the
still better things before the <span lang="it"><cite>Rose</cite></span> disabled him: and it is by no
means certain that he would have had the wit to appreciate
them if he had known them. He thinks the sonnet too “easy,”
poor man! condemns the elegy on the absurd ground that it
saddens the reader; and (committing the same fault in defence
which more modern critics have committed in attack) bases
his main, if not his whole, praise of <span lang="it"><cite>Ballade</cite></span> and <span lang="it"><cite>Chant Royal</cite></span>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span><span lang="it"><cite>Rondeau</cite></span> and <span lang="it"><cite>Rondel</cite></span>, on their mere difficulty. But his most unfortunate,
if not his most absurd, error was the line which, in
common with most respectable persons, both then and since, he
takes up against the <span lang="la"><i>verbum inusitatum</i></span>, as shown in the new
poetic diction of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Pléiade</cite></span>. This was doubly unlucky: first,
because the fifteenth-century poets whom he champions had
themselves “aureated” the language in or out of all conscience
already; and secondly, because this kind of criticism, whether
it be applied to Montaigne or Dryden, to Carlyle or Browning,
is always a dangerous delusion. Very classical critics have
pecked and mocked at the author of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Quintil Horatien</cite></span>
because he black-marks not merely words useful or beautiful,
like <span lang="fr"><i>sinueux</i></span>, <span lang="fr"><i>oblivieux</i></span>, <span lang="fr"><i>rasséréner</i></span>, but even such now sterling
coin as <span lang="fr"><i>liquide</i></span> and <span lang="fr"><i>patrie</i></span>. It would be well if they, or those
like them, would think twice before condemning, as neologisms,
terms which may not impossibly seem as much matter of course
to the twenty-fourth century as <span lang="fr"><i>patrie</i></span> does to the twentieth.
But the author of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Quintil</cite></span> is really of that breed of carping
critics which carps itself out of all common-sense. He makes
ponderous fun of the initial signature I. D. B. A. (“J. du Bellay
Angevin”); objects to the statement that “nature gave us
<em>tongues</em> to speak,” because Aristotle, Galen, and Petrus Hispanus
agree that palate, throat, lips, and teeth are also necessary
to the process; to the use of <span lang="fr"><i>voix</i></span> instead of <span lang="fr"><i>son</i></span>, where
animals are not concerned. The sea would have no voice
for him—and doubtless had none.</p>

<p class='c000'>From such mere “denigration” (the censor permits himself
this word as a stone to throw at Du Bellay) no good thing
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Pelletier’s</i> Art Poétique.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
could come: and besides, for some generation or
more, the brother stars were to fight in their courses
for Pléiade criticism as well as for Pléiade poetry. The second
<span lang="la"><cite>Ars Poetica</cite></span> of the French Renaissance—the first in any full
modern sense—appeared in 1555 from the hand of Jacques
Pelletier, himself a spelling reformer, a professor, and, what
is more, a mathematician; but a man of versatile ability and
much eagerness to welcome any new good thing, with no
small power of starting such things. He was a pleasant
poet, full of Pléiade manner before the Pléiade had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>formed; nor can even his absurd spelling<a id='r171'></a><a href='#f171' class='c019'><sup>[171]</sup></a> quite hide the
beauty of such things as</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr">“Alors que la vermeille Aurore.”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>And when, at the age of nearly forty, he wrote his <cite>Poetic</cite>, nobody
could charge him with being a mere theorist. He went heart
and soul for the <span lang="fr"><cite>Pléiade</cite></span> ideas, and like Du Bellay and the rest,
as indeed was unavoidable, busied himself first of all with the
reform of the language. He recommends the formation of a
regular poetic diction, and goes so far (I do not say that it is
too far) as to approve of retaining double forms, one fully
“frenchified,” one simply Latin with a French termination (<i>e.g.</i>,
<span lang="fr"><i>repousse</i></span> and <span lang="fr"><i>repulse</i></span>), the first for prosaic, the second for poetic
use. The famous Pléiade stumbling-blocks, the compound
epithet and the inverted order of words, are no stumbling-blocks
for him—he takes them triumphantly in the stride of his
revolutionary ardour: and he joins Ronsard also in the safer if
not more popular recommendation of archaism, and of adoption
of didactic forms at pleasure. No doubt he is not always wise:
though the Classical school which followed had lost the right to
reproach him with abusing the principle of suiting the sound to
the sense. But still there is a great wisdom in him. Himself
an excellent rhymer, he has some of the qualms about rhyme
which were so frequent in the sixteenth century; but he is
sound on the point (in French not admitting of any serious
contest) that without rhyme poetry becomes prose, and he is
more than lukewarm as to classical metres. It is sad but not
surprising that he joins Du Bellay in condemning the delightful
if not all-sufficing metrical kinds which had produced such
charming things from Lescurel to Villon; and he duly recommends
comedy, tragedy, and epic in their place. As he had
himself translated the <cite>Epistle to the Pisos</cite> eleven years earlier,
it is not wonderful that he sticks very close to it. Whether,
as has been said by some, he does not know Aristotle, may
not be quite certain; but it is certain that Aristotelian doctrines
make no figure in him: it will be remembered that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>they had not made much even in Italy at this time. In
fact, it seems reasonable to doubt whether, despite their adoration
of Greek, the Pléiade writers ever drew much direct
inspiration from the <cite>Poetics</cite>, though, in Italian translations
and commentaries at least, it must have influenced them to
some extent.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most interesting figure of Pléiade criticism, however, is,
as it should be, Ronsard<a id='r172'></a><a href='#f172' class='c019'><sup>[172]</sup></a> himself. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Ronsard: his general importance.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The greatness of this really
great poet must be injuriously affected, but ought
not to be obscured to critical judgment, both by the
fact (for which he is to blame) that he tried too
many things and wrote too much; and by the other fact (for
which he is blameless) that he attempted a new theory and
practice of poetry, not, like his younger and more fortunate contemporary
Spenser, at the beginning of a great poetic wave in
his own country, but at a time when that country’s energies
were steadily settling towards prose. Yet he was nothing if
not critical. The actual amount of critical expression that he
has left us is not large: it is a pity that he did not devote to it
some of the time which he might well have spared from his too
copious, and sometimes too undistinguished, versemanship. He
is, like Dryden (whom he resembles in not a few ways so much
that I should be surprised if the parallel has not struck others),
somewhat careless of outward consistency in his critical utterances—a
carelessness indicative in each case of real critical
sincerity, of the fact that the two poets were honestly seeking
the way, and had the sense not to persevere in blind alleys
when they found them blind. Above all, like the whole of his
school, he is distinguished by a critical note, which must be
dwelt on in the Interchapter succeeding this book, but which
may well be indicated here—the note that they are much more
bent on the production of new literature than on the study
of old.</p>

<p class='c000'>But, for all this, he is a remarkable critic, and in his critical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span><span lang="fr"><i>aperçus</i></span> we can ourselves perceive germs, indications, suggestions,
which might have resulted in the creation of a much larger
body of actual criticism. Indeed these are (as M. Pellissier<a id='r173'></a><a href='#f173' class='c019'><sup>[173]</sup></a>
and others have shown) actually responsible for much that is
most characteristic, and for most of what is best, in the Classical
school of the next century, which affected to despise him, as well
as for other things which, if that school had followed them out,
would have saved it from its most fatal mistakes and shortcomings.</p>

<p class='c000'>The main critical <span lang="la"><i>loci</i></span> in Ronsard have been duly pointed out
by his editor, M. Prosper Blanchemain. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> <span lang="fr">Abrégé de l’Art Poétique.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> They are the formal
<span lang="fr"><cite>Abrégé de l’Art Poétique</cite></span> of 1565; the prefatory
matter to his not too well-starred epic, the <span lang="fr"><cite>Franciade</cite></span>,
ten years later and onwards; and the remarkable
<span lang="fr"><cite>Caprice au Seigneur Simon Nicolas</cite></span>—a poem written late,
and not, it seems, published save posthumously. The “Abridgement”<a id='r174'></a><a href='#f174' class='c019'><sup>[174]</sup></a>
answers to its name, for it only fills just twenty Elzevirian
pages. It begins in a manner which shows (as so many other
things do in Ronsard) the gaps which separated him from, as
well as the ties which united him to, the usual thought of the
Renaissance, and still more that of the seventeenth century.
Although there are of course exceptions, the general drift of
Italian criticism had been that poetry, like any other art or
science, is a thing teachable and learnable. On no other ground
could the “archæolatry,” which we have found almost universal,
be maintained for a moment. Now Ronsard, though he dwells
again and again on the necessity of study, begins with an
apology for writing an Art of Poetry at all. He has had,
he says modestly, some experience and practice, and he will
do his best to give his correspondent<a id='r175'></a><a href='#f175' class='c019'><sup>[175]</sup></a> the benefit thereof. But
poesy is <span lang="fr"><i>plus mental que traditif</i></span>, which we may translate “more
native to the mind than communicable to it.” He accordingly
converts (with an agreeable twist) the stock invocation to the
Muses into a real prayer for this mental endowment, and with
equal ingenuity freshens up the stale <span lang="fr"><i>clichés</i></span> about the divinity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>of Ancient poets, and about the Muses refusing to lodge save
in a virtuous and pious mind. Therefore, too, study of these
former favourites of poetry is requisite. But from these
generalities he plunges straight into extremely minute details.
Greek, Latin, and French—it is probable that he does not
mention Italian because his correspondent, Delbène, was of
Italian extraction—are to be carefully studied as languages.
The rules of French prosody—among which is here for the first
time authoritatively included the alternation of masculine and
feminine rhymes—are to be carefully observed, and <em>e</em> is to be
always elided before a vowel. It is perhaps worth noting that
Ronsard uses “cæsura” for “elision,” a catachresis in which he
had followers, and which even affected Dryden. Greek and
Roman proper names are, where possible, to be frenchified in
termination. “The old words of our romances” (this is of the
first importance) are not to be ejected, but to be chosen with
care and prudence. Terms of art and technical similes are to
be sought out with extreme diligence, so as to supply life and
nerve to the book. Dialect-words may be used at need; the
example of the Greeks being invoked here—perhaps a little
rashly. Invention, says Ronsard, is the working of the Imagination;
but he seems still inclined to the old limitation of this
word to the retailing of images, and reprobates more strongly
than is perhaps necessary or desirable <span lang="fr"><i>ces inventions fantastiques
et mélancholiques qui ne se rapportent non plus l’une à l’autre
que les songes entrecoupés des frénétiques</i></span>. There is to be first
of all (note the Frenchman) Order and Disposition in poetical
devices.</p>

<p class='c000'>This order and this disposition are to be secured by a happy
nature in the first place, and by a careful study of good models
in the second. Among these good models, “those who have
illustrated our language in the last fifteen years” (<i>i.e.</i>, since the
<span lang="fr"><cite>Défense</cite></span>) are to be counted in; and (this was added later) foreign
modern languages are also to be carefully studied for the enriching
of the mother tongue. “Elocution” is nothing else than
“a propriety and splendour of words well chosen, and ornamented
with grave and short sentences, which make verses
shine, like as do precious stones, well mounted, the fingers of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>some great seignior.”<a id='r176'></a><a href='#f176' class='c019'><sup>[176]</sup></a> The vocabulary must be copious and
composed of well-sifted words, with plentiful description and
comparison, moulded specially on Homer. The common form
of “great” poem-making follows, with reference to Aristotle as
well as Horace, with caution against trite and otiose epithets,
against epithet-strings <span lang="fr"><i>à l’Italienne</i></span>, but with a strong praise of
the <span lang="fr"><i>mot propre</i></span>. Rhyme is treated rather briefly; and then
Ronsard drops to minutiæ of <em>e</em>'s and <em>h</em>'s, discusses Alexandrines
(which, in a later edition, he says he should have employed
in the <span lang="fr"><cite>Franciade</cite></span> but for powerful command) and “common”
(decasyllabic) verse, and others, passes to some grammatical and
orthographical cautions, and ends with the promise, unluckily
never fulfilled, of a longer <span lang="la"><cite>Poetic</cite></span> some day.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may have been in part payment of this promise that he
wrote the Prefatory matter to the <span lang="fr"><cite>Franciade</cite></span>.<a id='r177'></a><a href='#f177' class='c019'><sup>[177]</sup></a> <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Prefaces to the Franciade.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> This, which, as
it stands in the modern editions, is triform, consists
of a short Preface (or <span lang="fr"><i>Au Lecteur</i></span>) in prose, from the
master’s own hand, to the original edition; of a verse
exordium, or rather Introduction, separate from the poem proper;
and, between the two, of a second Preface or <cite>Treatise on Heroic
Poetry</cite> of some length, which we have, not as it left the author’s
pen, but arranged and revised (it is said under his direction) by
Claude Binet. The critical interest of the verse Proem lies in
the enthusiastic glorification of Homer and Virgil (who have
shown the whole secret of epic-writing, and whose work the
author bids his own “adore on its knees”), and in a spirited
reissue of the cardinal doctrine of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Pléiade</cite></span> that French
is a fertile soil, all overgrown and untilled, which must be
brought under cultivation by the unsparing labour of poets
and scholars.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first Preface begins with the time-honoured comparison,
or contrast, between History and Poetry, as dealing, the one
with verity, the other with verisimilitude. Hence Ronsard
strikes off to set Homer and Virgil far above all others, and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>fix a stigma on Ariosto as presenting a body handsome enough
in members, but so counterfeit and monstrous as a whole that
it is like an unwholesome dream. He has evidently on his
mind the objections, perhaps of the ancients, perhaps of some
Italians, to the combination of historical poetry, and endeavours
to meet the objection that he comes nearer to actual history
“than Virgilian art permits” by the rather perilous excuse
that Virgil only lived under a <em>second</em> emperor, while he himself
lives under the successor of a long line of kings, and that
Charles our Lord and King insisted on no invidious preference
being shown to some of his ancestors over the others. Indeed
Ronsard is too typical a Frenchman for a sense of humour to
be exactly his strong point.</p>

<p class='c000'>He then proceeds to name, as his example, rather “the naïve
facility of Homer than the curious diligence of Virgil”: though
he ventures to reprehend some excess of improbability in the
scheme and details of the <cite>Iliad</cite>, and ends with some particulars
of apology and explanation. The most curious of these are a
passage giving reasons (by no means in strict accordance with
the sentence referred to above) for rejecting the Alexandrine in
favour of the decasyllable, and a pathetic appeal to the reader
<em>not</em> to read his poem like an official document,<a id='r178'></a><a href='#f178' class='c019'><sup>[178]</sup></a> but to accommodate
his voice to its passion, and especially to raise that voice
whenever he comes to a mark of exclamation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The second, later, longer, and, as we have said, not quite
authentic, Preface, addressed to the <span lang="fr"><i>Lecteur Aprentif</i></span>, is a
discourse on the Heroic Poem in general; and as such is
responsible for the specimens of the kind with which the
next century was troubled in France, if not for those from
the <span lang="fr"><cite>Henriade</cite></span> downwards, which serve as even less cheerful
ornaments to the French literature of the eighteenth.
We have seen already how carefulness and trouble about
this thing had been gathering and growing in Italy, and
how it was, in Ronsard’s own days, causing the storm about
the <span lang="it"><cite>Gerusalemme</cite></span>. The “Maronolatry” which France shared
with Italy led to it directly; and even the championship
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>of Homer (as in Ronsard’s own case)—the attempt to
establish two kings of the Epic Brentford—was certain to
conduce to it. Ronsard himself, however, does not at first
attempt the general question; indeed it is hardly possible to
draw attention too often to the far greater abstinence from
general and deductive consideration which at this time characterises
the French critics, as compared with the Italians.
He begins with a fresh attack (not quite in the best faith, if
his own later remarks be pressed, as perhaps they need not
be) on the Alexandrine; and, by a deflection more natural
in the original than it appears in a summary, goes off to a
panegyric of periphrasis, which again was only too docilely
received by his successors of all schools for the next two
centuries in France. His examples are taken from Virgil—indeed
the earlier part of this Preface, at any rate, is as enthusiastically
Virgilian as Scaliger himself could desire. Then he
puts stress once more on the significant epithet, lays down
<span lang="la"><i>obiter</i></span> the delightfully arbitrary dictum that, as the unity of
drama is the revolution of a day, so the unity of at least a
war-epic is the revolution of a year, dwells largely on his
favourite distinction between the poet and the versifier, which
he justifies (not too well) by insisting on artful variations of
the narrative by speeches, dreams, prophecies, pictures,<a id='r179'></a><a href='#f179' class='c019'><sup>[179]</sup></a>
auguries, fantastic visions, and appearances of gods and
demons. All this time we have heard nothing of Homer,
and indeed have read nearly half a score pages before his
name occurs as furnishing Virgil with some of his facts and
personages, just as he had drawn his own from older stories,
“<span lang="fr">comme nous faisons des contes de Lancelot, de Tristan, de
Gauvain, et d’Artus,</span>” a passage to be noted. The dozen or so
which remain are oddly occupied by a sort of jumble of notes
and hints to the epic poet, reminding one of that valuable paper
of advice which Sir John Hawkins sent to Captain Amyas
Leigh, on “all points from the mounting of ordnance to the use
of vitriol and limmons against the scurvy.” He must describe
splendid palaces and grounds, trace heroes and heroines to
gods and nymphs, dress them handsomely, wound them in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>the right places,<a id='r180'></a><a href='#f180' class='c019'><sup>[180]</sup></a> not invent too much, allow himself <span lang="fr"><i>enjambement</i></span>
and hiatus, use plentiful comparisons and terms of art,
do things handsomely in general, boil his very kettles with a
Homeric afflatus,<a href='#f180' class='c019'><sup>[180]</sup></a> be thoroughly careful about study, but, above
all, attend to diction, as to which the cautions and licences of
the <span lang="fr"><cite>Abrégé</cite></span> are repeated in fuller form, with a special injunction
not to Ciceronianise idly, but to <span lang="fr"><i>faire un lexicon des vieils mots
d’Artus, de Lancelot, et de Gauvain</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ronsard will necessarily give us text for remark on the
criticism of the Pléiade in the Interchapter following this Book.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His critical gospel.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But we must say a little of his critical attitude here.
That it is of more interest than positive importance
cannot easily be denied. Not only for our purpose, but for its
own, it is injured by the very sincerity, practicalness, and common-sense
of the writer’s purpose and view. He clearly does
not regard the past of French literature with quite such a
petulant contempt as that of Pelletier and Du Bellay. But he
is even more steadily and thoroughly convinced that something
better can, should, and shall be done: and it is on the doing of
this, by himself and others, that all his thoughts are fixed. He
does not give himself the time—he does not, it is evident, think
it in the least worth while—to take a critical survey of the past
in any detail, or with any general grouping. It is enough for
him that Homer and Virgil are of the greatest, and that their
work is also of the greatest; and he wishes Frenchmen to go and
do likewise. He almost, if not altogether, accepts the end as a
datum; and is only troubled about the means. In regard to
some of these means his doctrine, though somewhat <span lang="fr"><i>ondoyant</i></span>
and even inconsistent, is surprisingly sound and original. If
part of it was accepted with advantage by his countrymen in
the centuries which followed, other parts were discarded and
neglected, with an almost incalculably disastrous result. That
“lexicon of the old words of <cite>Lancelot</cite> and <cite>Artus</cite>” would have
saved French from the drab smug insignificance of its eighteenth-century
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>garb; those cautions about <span lang="fr"><i>enjambement</i></span> and the like
might almost have done for France what Spenser and Shakespeare
did for England.</p>

<p class='c000'>But this comparative independence in some points was—probably
from the want of that real historical horizontality of
view which, of all the sixteenth-century critics, Cinthio, Castelvetro,
and Patrizzi alone seem in various degrees to have
attained—accompanied by a singular servility and conventionality
in others. “Why, O Prince of Poets!” one feels inclined
to say, “with all reverence to your grey and laurelled
head—why should we trouble ourselves about <span lang="fr"><i>peintures insérées
contre le dos d’une muraille, et des harnois, et principalement des
boucliers</i></span> because one very great poet found them useful to produce
historical effects nearly three thousand years ago, and
another much lesser poet chose to imitate him slavishly some
thousand years later? Why should we do it, even supposing
the two poets to be on a level? Very likely Homer’s warriors
<em>had</em> painted or graven bucklers. We have not. Arthur’s
knights had not—at least the paintings (assuming them to be
armorial) were quite different. Why should we have the
‘monstrous language of horses wounded to death’? Why this
childish limitation in imitation? Handsome dresses are admirable
things: but why must we be limited to lion-skins and
panther-skins and bearskins for the material? If we have got
to make a cauldron boil, let it double double, boil and bubble
by all means: but suppose we <em>don’t</em> want to boil it?” To all
this we not only get no answer from Ronsard; but in his critical
writing (not, as we have said, extensive nor always outwardly
consistent, but thoroughly uniform in spirit) we find no trace of
any such <span lang="la"><i>aporia</i></span> ever having presented itself to his mind. <em>They</em>
did these things and produced good effects: let <em>us</em> do them that
we may produce good. It seems a “good old rule” enough:
yet perhaps it is “a simple plan” also in more senses than
one.</p>

<p class='c000'>Good or bad, complete or incomplete, this criticism is the
very soul of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Pléiade</cite></span>. Its playwrights, such as Grévin<a id='r181'></a><a href='#f181' class='c019'><sup>[181]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>and Jean de la Taille,<a id='r182'></a><a href='#f182' class='c019'><sup>[182]</sup></a> followed Italian practice in prefixing
argumentative discussions to their plays—reflecting
on the mediæval drama, comparing, in modest or
buoyant spirit, their own work to that of the ancients, and the like.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Some minors.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> A section of the school (as was almost unavoidable, despite the
“No-Surrender” resistance which French as a language opposes
to the proceeding) tried classical metres after the principles of
Tolomei: and Jacques de la Taille, the brother of Jean, a poet
and dramatist of fantastic but distinct ability, wrote a tractate<a id='r183'></a><a href='#f183' class='c019'><sup>[183]</sup></a>
in defence of them. They made closer and closer approximations
to the absolute Trinity of Unities: and though Du Bellay
in his youthful fervour had committed himself to a not unwise
antinomianism, they more and more showed themselves as the
true ancestors of the neo-classic school, by framing and insisting
on “rules.” The great men of letters who were more or less
unattached, but well-willing irregulars of the school, such as
Pasquier and Montaigne, bestow, in their different ways, increasing
attention on literary criticism and literary history. And,
just before and after the junction of the centuries, when the
<span lang="fr"><cite>Pléiade</cite></span> proper had set, and its influence was about to wane
before the narrow and arbitrary classicism of Malherbe on the
one hand, and the rococo-picaresque of the Spanish school on
the other, there appeared two formal <cite>Arts of Poetry</cite>, the one the
complete and final code of Pléiade Poetic, the other a rather
hybrid and nondescript product, chequering Ronsardism with a
good deal of Italian matter.</p>

<p class='c000'>This last,<a id='r184'></a><a href='#f184' class='c019'><sup>[184]</sup></a> the earlier to appear, in 1598, had for author Pierre
de Laudun, sometimes spoken of, from a seignory of his, as de
Laudun d’Aigaliers. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Pierre de Laudun.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It is in prose, and its author,
who is roundly described by Herr Rücktaschel as a
“copyist of the purest water,” diversifies his borrowings from
Sibilet, Ronsard, and Pelletier on the one hand, from Scaliger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>and “<span lang="it">Vituperani</span>” on the other, with plentiful examples from
his own work; for he had followed one greater man with a
<span lang="fr"><cite>Franciade</cite></span> and ante-dated another with a <cite>Horace</cite>. I cannot
enter any strong protest against the hard words (not confined to
those already quoted) which his German critic bestows on him.<a id='r185'></a><a href='#f185' class='c019'><sup>[185]</sup></a>
His real interest is purely that of symptom and tendency, in
which respect he shows a rather odd but not uninstructive
mixture. On one side he rejects the Ronsardising coinage
of words and adoption of dialect forms, with other Pléiade
traits. On another he shows himself recalcitrant to the coming
classicastry by declaring that “we are not bound by their
laws”—<i>e.g.</i>, in regard to the number of acts. On a third we
find him emphasising this attitude into an absolute refusal
of the Unity of Time, against which he says almost all the
obvious and sensible things, in a fashion to some extent redeeming
what is on the whole the work of a not very intelligent
bookmaker.</p>

<p class='c000'>Vauquelin de la Fresnaye has not this sudden cry of the voice
in the desert: but his <span lang="fr"><cite>Art Poétique</cite></span> is, as a whole, a book of
infinitely greater interest and value than Laudun’s.
Vauquelin was a gentleman and lawyer of Normandy,
who, born at the <span lang="fr"><i>château</i></span> whence he took his name, near
Falaise, fought, amused himself, loved the country and its
sports, became President at Caen, and wrote verses of no small
merit in various kinds. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Vauquelin de la Fresnaye.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> His <span lang="fr"><cite>Art Poétique</cite></span> was more than thirty
years on the stocks: and having had its keel laid in 1574, when
the <span lang="fr"><cite>Pléiade</cite></span>, though a quarter of a century old, was still in
full flourishing, did not get launched till 1605, when a new age
had begun in more than chronological fashion. It is a composition
of considerable bulk, consisting of three books, each
running to rather under twelve hundred lines. Either of
deliberation, or as a result of intermittent attention during the
time in which it was a-preparing, Vauquelin arranged it (or
failed to arrange it) in most admired disorder. The precisians
of the next age would have been horrified at the promiscuous
character of its observations; and some would have been grateful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>to its latest editor<a id='r186'></a><a href='#f186' class='c019'><sup>[186]</sup></a> if, in addition to, or instead of, part of the
elaborate and very valuable <span lang="la"><i>apparatus criticus</i></span> of various kinds
which he has given, he had prefixed an argument. As it is, we
must make one: for the book, if not one of our very greatest
<span lang="fr"><i>points de repère</i></span>, is yet such a point.</p>

<p class='c000'>After a prose address to the Reader, containing a rather
touching reference to the flight of time and the change of
public opinion since he had begun his work, to
the cares of life, and the troubles of the realm, and
the death of old friends—he begins with the proper
invocation. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Analysis of his</i> Art Poétique.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Immediately after he gives, as has been justly
observed, a warning note by an elaborate simile-description
of Poesy as an ordered garden, with beds and paths and hedges,
wherein if any rude boy should trample on the beds, desert the
paths, and break down the espaliers, the gardener would
assuredly make injurious observations to him, and drive him
out—the Gardener being further identified as no less a person
than the Divinity. This comparison would of itself show that
Vauquelin aims at no arrogant originality; but he is yet more
explicit. His four guides are <span lang="fr"><i>le fils de Nicomache</i></span> (Aristotle, of
course; but note how Ronsard’s fatal counsel of periphrasis has
already sunk, never to be quite extracted, into the French
mind!), the “harper of Calabria” (Horace), Vida, and Minturno.<a id='r187'></a><a href='#f187' class='c019'><sup>[187]</sup></a>
But he hardly apologises for writing in French. Then,
borrowing from Cleanthes, through Seneca, the old comparison
of verse to “a trumpet which adds power to the voice,” he
passes <span lang="la"><i>non sine Dis</i></span>—with abundant indulgence in mythology—to
the exaltation of Number and Harmony at large, and to
theorising in the Imitation of Nature. He holds high the
banner of the Ronsardian unification of Arts; and while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>insisting that even the ugly may be made interesting, if not
beautiful, in the imitation of it, repeats the old cautions about
inconsistent and too fantastic admixture of imagery. Among
other followings of Ronsard we note the earnest advice to
cultivate stately descriptions and abundant ornament. But he
does not omit—though it must be allowed he does not observe
it over strictly himself—the caution to keep the thread,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr">“Si tu fais un Sonnet, ou si tu fais une Ode.”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>The praise of order and consistency gives place to remarks on
diction which repeat the Ronsardist canons and cautions, and
to a fashionable contempt (to be taken up later, as
so much else was, by the thankless Neo-Classics) of
Anagrams and Acrostics. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The First Book.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The usual twinning of Homer and
Virgil is succeeded by reference to some other classics: and for
a time Vauquelin seems to be confining himself (in so far as his
expatiatory manner ever admits confinement) to the <span lang="fr"><i>ouvrage
héroique</i></span>, whence he turns to other kinds, and the verse-forms
suitable for them. He repeats Du Bellay’s curse on <span lang="fr"><i>ballade</i></span> and
<span lang="fr"><i>rondeau</i></span>,<a id='r188'></a><a href='#f188' class='c019'><sup>[188]</sup></a> and passes like him to a special eulogy of the Sonnet,
in which (as Du Bellay was not able to do) he is able now to
produce a stately list of French practitioners. This part of the
Book, a little after its middle, is full of literary history and
allusion, the latter touching foreign languages and literatures as
well as French. And the rest of it is occupied with a fresh and
rather disorderly account of styles and kinds, with the verse
and diction proper to each, ending up with a curious amplification
of Quintilian’s story<a id='r189'></a><a href='#f189' class='c019'><sup>[189]</sup></a> about Apelles and Antigonus, the moral
of which seems to be a sort of <span lang="la"><i>Medio tutissimus ibis</i></span></p>

<p class='c000'>The Second Book also has its due invocations to the Muses
and the King: and Vauquelin divagates, in his amiable way,
for some hundred lines before he settles down to
paraphrase Horace’s warning about the <span lang="la"><i>scriptor
cyclicus</i></span>, and to give, as examples of exordium, not merely a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>refashioning in Alexandrines of the opening of Ronsard’s
<span lang="fr"><cite>Franciade</cite></span>, but a long extract from his own projected epic of the
<span lang="fr"><cite>Israëlide</cite></span>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Second.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But as soon as he has done this (to the extent, it is
true, of some fifty lines) he affects shame at quoting himself,
and bids the poet swim in the Greek and Latin sea, especially
in Virgil. In fact, Vauquelin is much more of a Virgil-worshipper
than Ronsard, and almost as much as Vida, if not as
Scaliger; and it is curious to see in his work that unconquerable,
and as it were magnetic, repulsion from the greater poetry
of Homer, and attraction towards the lesser verse of Virgil, which
more and more shows itself, from the start of the Renaissance
to the finish of the eighteenth century. Although he again and
again diverges to the prose Epic (with the usual example of
Heliodorus and the <span lang="fr"><cite>Æthiopica</cite></span>), to the artificial epic unity of a
year (which he doubtless took, after Ronsard, from Minturno),
and so forth, he as constantly returns to Virgil, describing him
in one place plumply as “second to Homer in age, but first
in rank.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he reverts to his Horace, and, not forgetting a hint to
the poet (one frequent with him) that he had better take French
and Christian subjects such as the crusade of St Louis, he
dilutes largely the famous clauses of his model on keeping
the type of age and youth, &#38;c. This leads him naturally to the
subject of drama, on which he is, of course, severely Horatian;
especially in regard to messengers and the avoidance of awkward
things on the stage. He has the <span lang="fr"><cite>Pléiade</cite></span> drama, too,
before him as he writes; extols the Chorus, and again does not
forget his hints of Christian subjects. But in the sequel he
leaves his ancient authorities, and their severer tastes, rather
on one side, in order to dwell at great length on the accessories
of the stage—music, <span lang="fr"><i>mise-en-scène</i></span>, &#38;c., with a not uninteresting
reference—like that of Sibilet (<i>v. supra</i>) earlier, and possibly
due to it—to the moralities of <span lang="fr"><i>nos vieux François</i></span>, as well as
a welcome to the Ballet and to his native <span lang="fr"><i>Vaux-de-Vire</i></span>. He
indulges in a warm eulogy of French as a language passing
all the vulgars of Europe, and of French poetry, and then
handles Satire, a subject in which he was an expert, and
which he had treated in a prose <cite>Discourse</cite>, joined to his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>exercises in the kind. He connects it with the Provençal
<span lang="fr"><cite>Sirvente</cite></span>, allows the <span lang="fr"><i>coq-à-l'âne</i></span> a sort of poor-relationship, and
dwells on French lyric poets at some length, once more commending
Latin models and (in a deflection, more logical than
some of his, to the subject of iambic and other metre) noticing
the recent attempts at a quantified prosody. On this subject
he prudently declines to commit himself: posterity must
decide. And the rest of the Book again busies itself with
various styles and kinds, the measures proper to them, and
the authors, modern as well as ancient, who have treated
them best.</p>

<p class='c000'>These lucubrations, however, disorderly as they may seem,
contain numerous things of interest—a just remark on rhyme
as practically the equivalent of stricter metrical arrangement;
observations on the prose <span lang="fr"><cite>Lancelot</cite></span>, &#38;c., showing that Vauquelin
was not destitute of that knowledge of the older literature of
his country which distinguished France and Frenchmen rather
creditably in the Renaissance, and to which we shall presently
return. Divers contemporary authors are also mentioned,
Garnier being singled out for special (and well deserved)
praise; and there is a pleasant reminiscence of the time
when</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr">Nous passions dans Poitiers l’Avril de notre vie,</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>and, instead of attending to the study of the law, followed the
frolics of the Muses. The actual close of the Second Book is a
neither undignified nor ill-felt wail over the sufferings of France
in the religious wars, and an expression of confidence in the
King’s powers of healing.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Third.</i></div>
<p class='c000'>The Third Book, after the usual decorative beginnings,
returns to Drama, and takes up Comedy, with praise for
Grévin and Belleau, and a long discussion of the
nature and varieties of the kind, including Tragi-comedy,
in which, naturally, the <span lang="fr"><cite>Bradamante</cite></span> of Garnier, the
only considerable example, is taken for study. Next a turn,
half abrupt, is made to Pastoral; and then Vauquelin returns to
his favourite Satire and to other forms, taking his texts from
Horace, Vida, and his own fancy, in a slightly bewildering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>manner, but to some extent carrying off the <span lang="fr"><i>à propos de bottes</i></span> of
his argument by his serene indifference to it, and the total
absence of any awkward apologies or attempts to join. By
degrees he settles, or seems to be settling, to the general questions
(What is the end of poetry? Instruction or Pleasure? and
the like), but turns from them to a long catalogue of the poets
of his time.</p>

<p class='c000'>The foot-by-foot following of Horace, which is more noticeable
than ever in the last three or four hundred lines—with
the licence of going off at any tangent from Horatian texts
which Vauquelin also permits himself—would account for any
amount of the desultoriness which is only disguised (if, indeed,
it can be said to be disguised) from the most careless, in Horace
himself, by the brevity of his scale and the brilliancy of his
phrase. But we do not, of course, go to Vauquelin for an orderly
treatise; we go to him that he may tell us what an interesting
and remarkable division of French men of letters knew of
criticism and thought of literature.</p>

<p class='c000'>His answer is not the less, but the more, valuable because of
its apparent incoherence, this incoherence being itself a piece of
evidence in the case. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His exposition of</i> Pléiade <i>criticism.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The <span lang="fr"><cite>Pléiade</cite></span>, as we have said
more than once, was eagerly critical; but it had a
strictly practical object, its criticism being entirely
subsidiary and preliminary to the desire of creation.
We meet here with nothing of the rather fatally “disinterested”
investigation of the Italians. Even the ancients are
studied less with a view to appreciating their beauties than
with the desire to steal their thunder.</p>

<p class='c000'>The precepts of Vauquelin’s four guides—of Horace first and
most of all, of Aristotle occasionally, of Vida pretty often, and
of Minturno <span lang="la"><i>nonnunquam</i></span>, are all adjusted to this end. Incidentally,
of course, Vauquelin shows us some general critical
views—the canonisation of Virgil, the adherence to the classical
Senecan drama, the discouragement of mediæval forms, if not
entirely of mediæval subjects and language. But, directly, he is
the technical instructor, not the theoretical critic. His <em>technique</em>,
with some slight alterations, is almost purely that of Ronsard,
and displays the same admixture of the classical tendency
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>which the seventeenth century took up and hardened, with a
quasi-romantic breadth and licence which that century rejected.
It is easy to say, and not very difficult to see, that it might—that
it actually did—result in a practice too promiscuous at
worst, at best a little too eclectic—that French was not ready
in point of time, and perhaps not quite suited in point of temperament,
for the bridle to be flung too freely on the neck of
Pegasus; and that Vauquelin is almost directly responsible for
inciting the growth of the weeds at which his successor Boileau
slashed with such a desperate hook sixty years later. It is
even possible to say, on the other side, that Du Bellay’s questioning
of rules altogether was, from the Romantic point of view,
sounder than Vauquelin’s provision of what may be called conditional
licences. We ought, however, to look at the <span lang="fr"><cite>Art
Poétique</cite></span> rather in the light of what had gone before its long-delayed
appearance than of what followed—at the production
of 1559-1600, not at that of 1600-1660. It is in effect an
<span lang="la"><i>a posteriori</i></span> rationalising and methodising of <span lang="fr"><cite>Pléiade</cite></span> Poetry.
This poetry is even now not much known in England, and its
defects—inequality, heaviness at times, pedantry, a strange and
almost irritating inability to get the wings quite free save at
rare moments—are undeniable. But there is something, in the
<i>Art</i> itself, of the better qualities of its subjects: and to those
who give themselves the trouble to make their acquaintance,
these subjects have a strange and a peculiar charm, in their
mixture of gravity and grace, of love and lore, of paganism and
piety, yea, of Classic and Romantic themselves. The <span lang="fr"><i>hedone</i></span> of
the <span lang="fr"><cite>Pléiade</cite></span> is <span lang="fr"><i>alethes</i></span> as well as <i>oikeia</i>, and in this handbook of
the school Vauquelin has revealed at least some of its secrets.
Those who can do this are no contemptible, and no common,
critics.</p>

<p class='c000'>But though Vauquelin thus sums up, in spirit as in time, the
formal criticism of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Pléiade</cite></span>, we have not yet quite done with
this. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Outliers: Tory, Fauchet, &#38;c.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It has been, throughout, the practice of this
book to take into consideration not only such formal
expressions, but also those of men who, outside formal
rhetoric or deliberate criticism, represent the literary taste of
their time. The latter part of the French sixteenth century is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>not poor in such. On the contrary, the interest in literature of
this kind which it displays perhaps exceeds that shown in any
country of Europe. Even Italy, despite its immensely greater
volume of formal literary discussion and academic literary history,
falls short in a certain intelligent independence of consideration.
We might draw on works of many kinds, from the
eccentric and mainly grammatical or typographical but extremely
interesting <span lang="fr"><cite>Champfleury</cite></span> of Geoffroy Tory (which, as
is well known, contains the original of Rabelais’ Limousin
scholar) as early as 1529; we might without too great straining
bring in Master Francis himself, and we cannot justly
neglect the name of Claude Fauchet, who almost deserves that
of Premier historian of literature in Europe. But, obeying that
system of representative treatment, especially in the outlying
departments, of the subject, the necessity of which grows more
urgent at every chapter and almost every page of this book, we
may chiefly deal with two writers, the one almost as much of
an antiquary and historian as Fauchet, but of greater literary
faculty and a pleasanter style; the other one of the great names
of the world’s letters, and, in his own fitful fashion, referring to
literature itself frequently and importantly enough. To those
who know anything of the time this last sentence will have
already named, without naming, Etienne Pasquier and Michel
de Montaigne.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chapters of Pasquier’s<a id='r190'></a><a href='#f190' class='c019'><sup>[190]</sup></a> <span lang="fr"><cite>Recherches de la France</cite></span>, in which
he deals with French literature, are perhaps the most interesting
of the whole. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Pasquier: The</i> Recherches.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He had himself been an ardent disciple
of the <cite>Pléiade</cite>, and a pleasant poet, in his
youth; and in his maturer years he applied to the
history of literature the same untiring research and sound
good sense which made him the first historical inquirer, as distinguished
from mere chroniclers, in France. It is not entirely
unimportant that, in his preliminary remarks on the subject, he
announces his intention of devoting his seventh book to French
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>Poetry and his eighth to French language—a pointed if unintentional
expression of the predominance of poetry in literature
even as late as the end of the sixteenth century. His first
observations are directed to the difference between French and
other modern languages on the one hand, and ancient poetry on
the other, in the matter of rhyme, which he would derive (not
without at least as much justification of probability and history
as other theorists can allege) from the rhythmical parallelisms
of prose speech, at first accidentally sweetened by homœoteleuton,
and then deliberately by rhyme itself. He is well aware
that the language of the Franks must have been German; and
his theory of French as composed of three languages, Walloon
(by which he probably means Gallic or Celtic), Latin, and
Frankish, will be more obnoxious to philological pedants than
to philosophical philologists. He knows the monorhymed <span lang="fr"><i>chansons</i></span>
such as <span lang="fr"><cite>Berte aux grans Piés</cite></span>, but is disposed to put them
unnecessarily late—nay, he seems to think that there was little
before the thirteenth century and Philip Augustus. Yet he is
not unaware of the much greater antiquity of the decasyllable
as compared with the Alexandrine.</p>

<p class='c000'>Indeed Pasquier has a not inconsiderable knowledge of
mediæval poetry—a knowledge at any rate extending far
beyond that of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Pléiade</cite></span> generally, who were as
a rule content to recognise, with a certain toleration,
the <span lang="fr"><cite>Roman de la Rose</cite></span>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His knowledge of older French literature</i>,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He knows and praises
Helinand, the authors of the great <span lang="fr"><cite>Alixandre</cite></span>,
Thibaut de Champagne, Chrestien de Troyes, Raoul de
Houdenc—not merely, it would seem, from Fauchet’s book,
but in themselves; and he quotes <span lang="fr"><cite>Ogier le Danois</cite></span>, <span lang="fr"><cite>Athis et
Prophilias</cite></span>, <span lang="fr"><cite>Cléomadès</cite></span>, &#38;c. Like a sensible man, he has that
indispensable chapter on Provençal literature which some
would cast out of French literary history, thereby making it
unintelligible. And then he passes to the prose Arthurian
romances, and to the formal poetry of the fourteenth century,
of which he speaks without any of the exaggerated and
slightly unintelligent—certainly intolerant—contempt of Du
Bellay and Vauquelin. “<span lang="fr"><i>Servitude, que je ne die gêne d’esprit,
admirable</i></span>,” “<span lang="fr"><i>ces mignardises</i></span>” are his mild censures of them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>and he gives particular attention to Froissart and Alain
Chartier, with mention of Villon and others, and a very high
eulogium of <span lang="fr"><cite>Pathelin</cite></span>. He does not, he says, know the author
(nor do we), but he will dare to say that this farce, as a whole
and in parts, <span lang="fr"><i>fait contrecarre</i></span> to the comedies of both Greeks
and Romans. He is fairly copious on the men of letters of the
first half of the century, and then begins a new chapter with the
picturesque and often-quoted phrase about the “great fleet of
poets” that the reign of Henri II. brought forth, and their new
style of poetry.</p>

<p class='c000'>He gives to Maurice Scève the honour of captaining the
leading ship of this fleet; and then follow all the well-known
names (and some not so well known) of the school
proper, the catalogue being capped by some extremely
interesting and valuable critical-anecdotic
remarks on the greater writers, especially Ronsard
himself. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>and criticism of contemporary French poetry.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> One could hardly be more just on this difficult<a id='r191'></a><a href='#f191' class='c019'><sup>[191]</sup></a> poet
than is Pasquier, who allows him not merely grandeur but
sweetness to almost any extent, “<span lang="fr">quand il a voulu <em>doux couler</em></span>”;
calls him <span lang="fr"><i>grand poète entre poètes</i></span>, but admits that he was <span lang="fr">“très
mauvais censeur et aristarque de ses livres.”</span> Then he partly
returns upon his steps in another chapter, where he approaches
French poetry from a different side, considering especially its
verse-structure, with examples from Marot downwards, and
dwelling on the alternation of masculine and feminine rhymes
which Ronsard had sanctioned. On this matter the historical
equity of Pasquier is especially noticeable, as opposed to the somewhat
excessive correctness (according to pedagogic ideas of the
correct) shown by most Frenchmen. He declines to take a side
between “this new diligence and the old nonchalance.” And
he makes the very acute observation that Marot only allowed
himself this nonchalance in verse <em>which was not to be sung</em>—a
proof, as he remarks, that though Master Clement might not be
Ronsard’s equal in learning, he had a <span lang="fr"><i>facilité d’esprit admirable</i></span>.
In yet another passage he compares French with Italian poetry,
and, emboldened by this, with Latin itself; taking the patriotic
side with equal courage and ingenuity, and ending with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>citation of some of his own Latin verses on Ronsard, and with
the sigh, “<span lang="fr">De toute cette grande compagnie qui mit la main
à la plume sous Henri II. il restait quatre, Théodore de Bèze,
Ponthus de Thyard, Louis le Caron, et moi.</span>” Then, after a
short appendix-chapter on classical metres in French (which he
would like to approve, but seems in two minds about), he passes
to language, on his treatment of which we cannot dwell. But
he never allows himself to stray far from literature, and makes
a pretext for returning at some length to his beloved <span lang="fr"><cite>Pathelin</cite></span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may be observed that Pasquier, though interested in letters
to an extreme degree, enjoys more than he judges—not perhaps
the worst defect of the critic.</p>

<p class='c000'>The agile and penetrating intelligence of Montaigne could
hardly have failed in any age to devote itself to literature; in
his own age this devotion was especially inevitable.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Montaigne: his references to literature.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> That his dealings with the subject are dealings in
the height of his own fashion, it is unnecessary to
say. Not many things could be more characteristic than the
Essay on Pedantry (I. 24), in which the whole spirit and
motive, not merely of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Pléiade</cite></span>, but of the sixteenth century
generally, are subjected to the irregular glancing criticism of
the essayist. This single paper would enable one to understand
the fling of a man like Ben Jonson—the reverse of
unintelligent, the reverse of unhumorous, but full of erudition,
and of sixteenth-century reverence for it—at “All the
essayists, even their master Montaigne.” On the general
question whether what is commonly called pedantry is a good
or a bad thing, Montaigne’s verdict comes simply to a “Mass!
I cannot tell!” He bestows hearty praise on Du Bellay, a
non-pedantic and courtier-like man of letters, who yet was
enthusiastic for learning; heartier on Adrian Turnebus, a
pedant in the common injurious sense; and in the middle of
his essay he plays on study of Greek and Latin, on quotations
from Plato and Cicero, on “arming oneself against the fear of
death, at the cost and charges of Seneca.”<a id='r192'></a><a href='#f192' class='c019'><sup>[192]</sup></a> The much longer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>chapter on Education, addressed to Diane de Foix, which
immediately follows, contains one of the worst expressions of
Renaissance contempt of mediæval literature, in the boast that
“of the Lancelots of the Lake, the Amadis, the Huons of
Bordeaux, with which childhood amuses itself,” he did not
know so much as the name. “My Lord Michael” is great,
but even he might have been greater if he <em>had</em> known them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Indeed hardly anywhere does Montaigne exhibit his own
undulation and diversity more fully than in relation to letters—at
one time amassing ancient instances as if he were totally
oblivious of the remarks above about Plato and Seneca; at
another criticising for himself<a id='r193'></a><a href='#f193' class='c019'><sup>[193]</sup></a> with inimitable freshness and
gusto; and at another again informing the scholar, with much
coolness, that if he will take off hood and gown, drop Latin,
and not deafen men’s ears with unmitigated Aristotle, he will
be at the level of all the world, and perhaps below it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Even this, it will be seen, is not so very far from the cardinal
<span lang="fr"><cite>Pléiade</cite></span> principle, that study of the ancients is an excellent
thing, but that its chief value is to equip and strengthen the
student for practice in French. And Montaigne, like the rest
of his contemporaries and compatriots, always had this
“cultivation of the garden” before him. It is well known
how the real pedants of his own time objected to his neologisms,
just as Fontaine (or whoever was the author of the
<span lang="fr"><cite>Quintil</cite></span>) did to those of Du Bellay; and how large a part
these neologisms played in the development and nourishing of
French prose. Every one who knows anything of Montaigne
knows his enthusiastic eulogy of Amyot, and of the services
which that <span lang="fr"><i>grant translateur</i></span> had rendered to French. And
everybody should know the delicate and subtle appreciation
which he lavishes, in a fashion so different from the indiscriminate
laudations of Scaliger, on favourite passages of the
ancients, more particularly<a id='r194'></a><a href='#f194' class='c019'><sup>[194]</sup></a> on the Venus and Vulcan passage
of Virgil, and the Venus and Mars passage of Lucretius.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>Of course Montaigne’s interests, despite his exquisite literary
accomplishment, are not primarily literary. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Essay</i> On Books.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But he has given
one entire Essay (II. 10), and that not of the
shortest, to Books; and he has frequent glancings
at the subject, sometimes characteristically racy, as that at the
<span lang="fr"><cite>Heptameron</cite></span>, “<span lang="fr">un gentil livre <em>pour son estoffe</em>.</span>” The “Books”
essay begins with one of his familiar jactations of imperfection.
He has some reading, but no faculty of retention. He often
intentionally plagiarises—for instance from Plutarch and
Seneca. He does not seek in books anything more than
amusement and knowledge of himself and of life. He refuses
to grapple—at any great expense of labour—with difficulties.
He likes Rabelais, Boccaccio, and Johannes Secundus for mere
pastime, but repeats his depressing scorn for romances, and
confesses, as did Darwin on the score of Shakespeare, that he
cannot take the pleasure he used to take in Ariosto and Ovid.
He thinks Virgil, Lucretius, Horace, and Catullus (especially
Virgil in the <cite>Georgics</cite> and the Fifth <cite>Æneid</cite>) at the top of poetry—a
grouping which makes us long to pin the elusive Perigourdin
down, and force him, Proteus as he is, to give us his
exquisite reasons. His judgment on Lucan is a little commonplace,
“not the style but the sentiments”—whereas the sentiments
of Lucan are but Roman “common form,” and his style,
if not of the best kind, is great in a kind not the best. He
thinks Terence “the very darling and grace of Latin,” and
is half apologetic as to the equalling of Lucretius to Virgil,
positively violent (it is, he thinks, <span lang="fr"><i>bestise et stupidité barbarique</i></span>)<a id='r195'></a><a href='#f195' class='c019'><sup>[195]</sup></a>
on that of Virgil to Ariosto, and depressing again in regard to
Plautus (Terence <span lang="fr"><i>sent bien mieux son gentilhomme</i></span>). He returns
again and again to the style of Terence; and warns us of
the coming classicism by his objections to the “<span lang="fr">fantastiques
élévations Espagnoles et Pétrarchistes,</span>” being equally “correct”
in exalting (or at least in his reasons for the exaltation, there
being no doubt about the fact) Catullus above Martial. On
Greek authors as such he frankly and repeatedly declares his
incompetence to give judgment; but “now that Plutarch has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>been made French,” he can as frankly yoke him once more
with Seneca, and extol the pair <span lang="la"><i>super æthera</i></span>, boldly expressing
his comparative distaste for Cicero. He would like to have
“a dozen of [Diogenes] Laertius,” for the “human document,”
of course; and puts Cæsar above all other historians, including
Sallust, while he has something to say of divers French writers
of the class—Froissart (who, he thinks, gives “the crude matter
of history”), Comines, Du Bellay-Langey, and others. It is to
be noted that in this place he says nothing about French poetry.
And when he does take up the subject much later, in II. 17, at
the end of the “Essay on Presumption,” he is very brief, only
saying that he thinks Ronsard and Du Bellay “hardly far from
the ancient perfection.” At the beginning of II. 36 he divides
with the majority on the merits of Homer and Virgil, though
he once more admits a disqualification, which in this case is, of
course, total. And in the famous remark,<a id='r196'></a><a href='#f196' class='c019'><sup>[196]</sup></a> “Poetry is an
amusement proper for women; it is a frolic and subtle art,
disguised, talkative, quite occupied with pleasure and display,
like them,” he gives no doubt a certain measure of his critical
capacity in less specially conditioned matters.</p>

<p class='c000'>This capacity is, indeed, strictly limited. Montaigne is
almost, if not quite, as much set as his beloved Plutarch on
the <em>life</em>-side of literature, as the only one that really interests
him; and, in addition, he has an obstinate prosaic inclination,
with which Plutarch does not seem to be nearly so chargeable.
Yet he must have found mention here, not merely as our first
very great French man of letters,<a id='r197'></a><a href='#f197' class='c019'><sup>[197]</sup></a> who has left us literary
opinions, but as the very light and glory of the French intellect
at the meeting of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and
as thus giving an index of the greatest value to its tastes and
opinions. He displays (conditioning it in the ways just mentioned,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>and others, by his intense idiosyncrasy) the general
literary attitude of the time—an active, practical, striving
towards performance, a rather conventional and arbitrary
admiration of the farther past, a contempt, or at least good-natured
underestimation, of the nearer, and fair, if vague, hopes
for the future. But considering the intensely critical character
of Montaigne’s intellect in most directions, its exertions in this
direction tell us even more by what they do not, than by what
they do.</p>

Between Fabri and Gratien du Pont
appeared in 1529 Geoffrey Tory’s
<span lang="fr"><cite>Champfleury</cite></span>, a more grammatical than
critical miscellany, which is elsewhere
glanced at; and the very noteworthy
critical remarks prefixed by Marot to
his edition of Villon in 1533. M.
Gaston Paris is assuredly right when
he calls this (in his charming little
book on the author of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Ballade des
Pendus</cite></span>, Paris, 1901) “<span lang="fr">un des plus
anciens morceaux de critique littéraire
que l’on ait écrits en français,</span>” and its
appreciative sympathy, if not co-extensive
with the merits of the work,
leaves little to desire in the points
which it touches. In fact, the mere
selection of Villon and of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Roman
de la Rose</cite></span>, as the subjects of his editorial
care, shows in Master Clement the
presence of a deep instinctive critical
faculty, which has only partially and
incidentally developed itself. In this,
as in not a few other points, Marot
himself seems to me to have had for
the most part inadequate justice from
critics; though here as elsewhere it
may be allowed that time and circumstance
prevented him from doing himself
justice. His intense affection for
literature and poetry, the light glancing
quality of his wit and intellect, the
absence of all pomposity, pedantry,
and parade, and the shrewd sense
which (in judgment if not quite in
conduct) distinguished him, go very
far to constitute the equipment of the
accomplished critic. But his short life,
perhaps a certain instability of character,
and the immature condition of
the special state of literature in his
time, with the ever-deplorable distractions
of the religious upheaval, gave him
little chance.</p>

who would thoroughly appreciate the

it briefly in my <cite>Short History</cite> of the

of all, to the last 150 pp. of the first

<div class='footnote' id='f164'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r164'>164</a>. For a poet of such eminence and a

of access. M. Marty-Laveaux' ed. of
the Works, with the Pléiade generally
(Paris, 1876), is very scarce and dear.
M. Becq de Fouquières’ <cite>Selections</cite> are, it
is said, out of print, though they can be
obtained. A Versailles reprint I know
only through the British Museum Catalogue.
It is odd how, in almost all

seems to “go by favour.”</p>

<em>do</em> get much more. English, for instance,
profited almost infinitely by
translation from French and from
Latin prose in the late fourteenth century,
and throughout the fifteenth.
But French was past this stage, or
nearly past it, when Du Bellay wrote.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r168'>168</a>. M. Brunetière quotes this famous

that we are not told how it is to be

reply to this in famous words, “by
reading, marking, learning, and inwardly
digesting.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f169'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r169'>169</a>. The small space given to the <span lang="fr"><cite>Défense</cite></span>
here may seem inconsistent with
the importance assigned to it. The
fact is, however,—and this fact no
doubt explains to some extent, if it
does not excuse, the views of those
who do <em>not</em> think it very important,—that
its details require little notice.
Its claim lies in its eager eloquence,
in the new position sketched above,
and (negatively) in its onslaught on
the forms of French poetry for two
hundred years past. Du Bellay’s
critical views reappear in the “Epistle
to the Reader” in his <span lang="it"><cite>Olive</cite></span> (ed. Becq
de Fouquières, pp. 67-76), in that
prefixed to his <span lang="it"><cite>Vers Traduits</cite></span> (ibid.,

vernacular verse addressed to the

It appears not unnecessary to say
that “Quintil” has not, and could not
have, any reference to “Quintilian,”
but refers to the Quintilius of Horace
(<span lang="la"><cite>Art. Po.</cite></span>, 438). The original edition
seems to be very rare: the British
Museum only possesses the Lyons reprint
(with Sibilet) of 1556. It seems
to have been also reprinted with Du
Bellay at Versailles in 1878, but this I
do not possess. Some make the title

French editor, indeed, speaks of Minturno
rather oddly, coupling him with
Vida as <span lang="fr">“les deux <i>poètes</i> Italiens,”</span> and
saying that both “<span lang="fr">ne font que remâcher

only says of Vida. This is of
more than doubtful justice as to Minturno,
and why call him a “poet”?

<p class='c004'>The fortune of England in matters political has often been
noticed; and it has at least deserved to be noticed, hardly less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>often, in matters literary. One of the luckiest of these chances
came at the time of the Renaissance; when the necessary
changes were effected with the minimum of direct foreign
influence, and so slowly that the natural force of the nation
and the language was able completely, or almost completely,
to assimilate the influences, both foreign and classical, that
rained upon it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor was this least the case in respect of criticism.<a id='r198'></a><a href='#f198' class='c019'><sup>[198]</sup></a> The
history of this part of English literary evolution has been,
until recently, much neglected; and it can hardly
be said even yet to have received comprehensive
attention. <span class='sni side12'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Backwardness of English Criticism not implying inferiority.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It is all the more necessary to bestow
some time and pains on it here, with at least some
fair hope of correcting an unfair depreciation. The
Baron of Bradwardine (displaying that shrewd appreciation of
contrast between English and Scottish characteristics which
belonged, if not to himself, to his creator) remarked to Colonel
Talbot that it was the Colonel’s “humour, as he [the Baron] had
seen in other gentlemen of birth and honour” in the Colonel’s
country, “to derogate from the honour of his burgonet.” Gentlemen
of the most undoubted birth and honour (as such things go
in literature), from Dryden to Matthew Arnold, have displayed
this humour in regard to English criticism. But there has been
something too much of it; and it has been taken far too
literally by the ignorant. M. Brunetière has expressed his
opinion that Frenchmen would make <span lang="fr"><i>un véritable marché de
dupe</i></span> if they exchanged Boileau, Marmontel, La Harpe, and Co.
for Lessing and some others. I shall not in this place express
any opinion on that question directly. But, if this book does
what I shall endeavour to make it do, it will at least show
that to exchange, for any foreign company, our own critics,
from Sidney and Ben Jonson, through Dryden and Addison,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>Samuel Johnson and Coleridge, Lamb and Hazlitt, to Mr Arnold
himself, would be “<span lang="fr"><i>un véritable marché de</i></span>”—Moses Primrose.</p>

<p class='c000'>It will have been sufficiently seen in the last volume that
the backwardness of English—a backwardness long exaggerated,
but to some extent real, and to no small extent healthy—was
nowhere exhibited more distinctly than in the department
which supplies the materials of this history. Until the close
of the fifteenth century, and for some decades afterwards, not
a single critical treatise on English existed in the English
language, or even in Latin; the nearest approach, even in
fragment, to any utterance of the kind being the <span lang="fr"><i>naïf</i></span> and
interesting, but only infantinely critical, remarks of Caxton
in his prefaces.<a id='r199'></a><a href='#f199' class='c019'><sup>[199]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The fact is that, not only until a nation is in command of
a single form of “curial” speech for literary purposes, but
until sufficient experiments have been made in at
least a majority of the branches of literature,
criticism is impossible, and would, if possible, be rather mischievous
than beneficial. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Its cause.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Now England, though it possessed
at least one very great author, and more than a fair number
of respectable seconds to him, was, up to 1500 at least, in
neither case. Till the end of the fourteenth century it had
been practically trilingual; it was bilingual till past the end
of the fifteenth, if not till far into the seventeenth, so far as
literature was concerned. Nor, till the towering eminence of
Chaucer had helped to bring the vernacular into prominence,
was there any one settled dialect of primacy in the vernacular
itself. Further, the fifteenth century was nearly at its end
before any bulk of prose, save on religious subjects, was written;
and for another century the proportion of translation over
original work in prose was very large indeed.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the same time the scholastic Rhetoric—which had always
played to criticism the part of a half-faithless guardian, who
keeps his pupil out of the full enjoyment of his property,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>yet preserves that property in good condition to hand over
to him perforce at some future time—was still
faithfully taught.<a id='r200'></a><a href='#f200' class='c019'><sup>[200]</sup></a> <span class='sni side12'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The influence of Rhetoric and other matters.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The enlarged and more accurate
study of the classics at the Revival of Learning
set classical criticism once more before students in
the originals; the eager study of those originals by Continental
scholars was sure to reflect itself upon England; and, lastly,
religious zeal and other motives combined, here as elsewhere,
to make men determined to get the vernacular into as complete
and useful a condition as possible. Nowhere does the intense
national spirit, which is the glory of the Tudor period, appear
more strongly than in this our scholastic and “umbratile”
division of the national life.</p>

<p class='c000'>Long, indeed, before this scholastic and regular criticism made
its appearance, and during the whole course of the fifteenth
century, critical appreciation, stereotyped and unmethodised
it may be, but genuine for all that, and
stimulating, had made its appearance. <span class='sni side3'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Hawes.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The extraordinary
quality of Chaucer, the amiable pastime-making of Gower,
and, a little later, the busy polygraphy and painful rhetoric
of Lydgate, had, almost from the moment of Chaucer’s death,
attracted and inspired students. The pretty phrase about
Chaucer’s “gold dew-drops of speech,” which justly drew the
approval of a critic so often unjustly severe on ante-Renaissance
work as Mr Arnold, was, as is known even by tyros in
the study of English literature, repeated, expanded, varied by
almost every prominent writer for a century and a quarter at
least, till it reaches, not exactly final, but most definite and
noteworthy, expression in the work of Stephen Hawes, that
curious swan-singer of English mediæval poetry. In the to us
eccentric, if not positively absurd, exposition of the <span lang="la"><i>Trivium</i></span>
and <span lang="la"><i>Quadrivium</i></span> which diversifies the account of the courtship
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>of Grandamour and La Bell Pucell,<a id='r201'></a><a href='#f201' class='c019'><sup>[201]</sup></a> the praise of the Three is
led up to by a discussion of Rhetoric and Poetics so elaborate
and minute that it occupies more space than is given to all the
other Arts together, and nearly double that which is given to all
the rest, except a largely extended Astronomy. Rhetoric herself,
after being greeted by and greeting her pupil in the most
“aureate” style, divides herself into five parts, each of which
has its chapter, with a “Replication against ignorant Persons”
intervening, and many curious digressions such as the description
of a sort of Earthly Paradise of Literature with four rivers,
“Understanding,” “Closely-Concluding,” “Novelty,” and “Carbuncles,”<a id='r202'></a><a href='#f202' class='c019'><sup>[202]</sup></a>
and a “Tower of Virgil” in their midst. Lydgate
has been already praised for “versifying the depured rhetoric in
English language,” but he comes up once more for eulogy as
“<em>my</em> master” in the peroration, and has in fact considerably
more space than either Gower or Chaucer. Nor, confused and
out of focus as such things must necessarily appear to us, should
we forget that Hawes and his generation were not altogether
uncritically endeavouring at what was “important to <em>them</em>”—the
strengthening and enriching, namely, of English vocabulary,
the extension of English literary practice and stock.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet their criticism could but be uncritical: and the luck
above referred to appears first in the peculiar scholastic character
of the criticism of the first English school of
critics deserving the name. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The first Tudor critics.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> No one of its members
was exactly a man of genius, and this was perhaps
lucky; for men of genius have rarely been observed to make
the best schoolmasters. All were fully penetrated with the
Renaissance adoration of the classics; and this was lucky again,
because the classics alone could supply the training and the
models just then required by English prose, and even to some
extent by English poetry. All were very definitely set against
Gallicising and Italianising; and yet again this was lucky,
because England had been overdosed with French influence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>for centuries, while their opposition to Italian did perhaps
some good, and certainly little harm. But all were thoroughly
possessed by the idea that English, adjusted to classical models
as far as possible, but not denationalised or denaturalised,
ought to be raised into a sufficient medium of literary, as
of familiar, communication for Englishmen. And—with that
intense Renaissance belief in education, and a high and noble
kind of education too, which puts to shame the chattering
and pottering of certain later periods on this unlucky subject—all
were determined, as far as in them lay, to bring English
up to this point. The tendency was spread over a great
number of persons, and a considerable period of time. Its
representatives ranged from healthy and large-souled, if not
quite heroic or inspired, scholars like Ascham to “acrid-quack”
pedants like Gabriel Harvey. But the chief of these
representatives were the well-known trio, of whom one has
just been mentioned—Sir<a id='r203'></a><a href='#f203' class='c019'><sup>[203]</sup></a> Thomas Wilson, Sir John Cheke,
and Roger Ascham. They were all friends, they were all contemporary
members (to her glory be it ungrudgingly said) of
one University, the University of Cambridge, and though the
moral character of all, and especially of the first two, had
something of the taints of self-seeking and of sycophancy,
which were the blemishes of the Tudor type of writers, all
had the merits of that type as exhibited in the man of the
study rather than of the field—intense curiosity and industry,
a real patriotism, a half-instinctive eagerness to action, a consciousness
how best to adorn the Sparta that had fallen to
their lot, and a business-like faculty of carrying their conceptions
out. From various indications, positive and indirect, it
would seem that Cheke, who was the eldest, was also the most
“magnetic,” the most Socratically suggestive and germinal of
the three: but his actual literary work is of much inferior
importance to that of Ascham and Wilson.</p>

<p class='c000'>Wilson’s <cite>Art of Rhetoric</cite><a id='r204'></a><a href='#f204' class='c019'><sup>[204]</sup></a> is, as the other dates given in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>text and notes will show sufficiently, by no means the first
book of the school; nor is it that which has, on the
whole, the most interest for us. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Wilson: his</i> Art of Rhetoric;<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But it deserves
precedence historically because, as no other does, it
keys, or gears, the new critical tendency on to the old technical
rhetoric. The first edition appeared in 1553, dedicated to
Edward VI. Wilson dates his prologue to the second<a id='r205'></a><a href='#f205' class='c019'><sup>[205]</sup></a> on the
7th December 1560; but it does not seem to have been published
till 1563. Between the date of the first edition and the
writing of this Prologue, Wilson, an exile at Rome, had fallen
into the claws of the Inquisition as author of the book and of
another on Logic; and, as he recounts with natural palpitation,
escaped literally “so as by fire,” his prison-house being in
flames.</p>

<p class='c000'>His two first Books Wilson faithfully devotes to all the old
technicalities—Invention, Disposition, Amplification, “States,”
and the rest. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>his attack on “Inkhorn terms.”</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But his third Book, “Of Elocution,”<a id='r206'></a><a href='#f206' class='c019'><sup>[206]</sup></a>
announces from the first an interest in the matter
very different from the jejune rehashings of the
ancients (and chiefly of those ancients least worth rehashing)
which the mediæval Rhetorics mostly give us. In fact, Wilson
had shown himself alive to the importance of the subject in
the very opening of the work itself<a id='r207'></a><a href='#f207' class='c019'><sup>[207]</sup></a> by recounting, with much
gusto, how “Phavorinus the Philosopher (as Gellius telleth the
tale) did hit a young man over the thumbs very handsomely
for using over-old and over-strange words.” And as soon as
he has divided the requirements of Elocution under the four
heads of Plainness, Aptness, Composition, and Exornation, he
opens the stop which has been recognised as his characteristic
one, by denouncing “strange inkhorn terms.” He inveighs
against the “far-journeyed gentlemen” who, on their return
home, as they love to go in foreign apparel, so they “powder
their talk with oversea language,” one talking French-English,
another “chopping in” with English-Italianated. Professional
men, lawyers and auditors, have their turn of censure, and a real
literary “document” follows in the censure of the “fine courtier
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>who will talk nothing but Chaucer.” Most copious is he
against undue “Latining” of the tongue, in illustration of
which he gives a letter from a Lincolnshire gentleman which
may owe royalty either to the Limousin Scholar of Rabelais, or
even to Master Francis’ own original, Geoffrey Tory himself.
And he points the same moral (very much after the manner of
Latimer, for whom, as elsewhere appears, he had a great
admiration) by divers facetious stories from his experience,
“when I was in Cambridge, and student in the King’s College,”
and from other sources. After which he falls in with Cicero
as to the qualifications of words allowable.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Aptness” follows: and here Sir Thomas, without knowing
it, has cut at a folly of language revived three hundred years
and more later than his own time. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His dealing with Figures.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> For he laughs
at one who, “seeing a house fair-builded,” said to
his fellow, “Good Lord, what a handsome <em>phrase</em> of building is
this!” Wilson’s butt would have been no little thought of by
certain persons at the end of the nineteenth century and the
beginning of the twentieth. Indeed, one may seem to remember
a sentence about the merits of a “passage” in a
marble chimney-piece, which is a mere echo, conscious or unconscious,
of his “phrase.” The same temper appears in the
longer remarks on Composition; but when we come to Exornation,
“a gorgeous beautifying of the tongue with borrowed
words and change of sentence,” Wilson’s lease of originality
has run out. He is still in the bondage of the Figures, which
he describes ambitiously as a kind “not equally sparpled<a id='r208'></a><a href='#f208' class='c019'><sup>[208]</sup></a>
about the whole oration, but so dissevered and parted as stars
stand in the firmament, or flowers in a garden, or pretty-devised
antiques in a cloth of Arras.” The enumeration is
full of character and Elizabethan piquancy; but it still has
the old fault of beginning at the wrong end. When a man
writes even a good oration, much more that far higher thing
a good piece of prose (which may be an oration, if need serves,
or anything else), he does not say to himself, “Now I shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>throw in some hyperbaton; now we will exhibit a little anadiplosis;
this is the occasion surely for a passage of zeugma.”
He writes as the spirit moves him, and as the way of art leads.
One could wish, in reading Wilson, for another Sir Thomas,
to deal with the Figurants as he has dealt with the Chaucerists
and the Lincolnshire Latinisers. But we must not expect too
much at once: and lucky are we if we often, or even sometimes,
get so bold a striking out into new paths for a true end
as we find in this <cite>Art of Rhetoric</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cheke has left no considerable English work, and he seems—as
it is perhaps inevitable that at least some of the leaders
in every period of innovation should seem—to have
pushed innovation itself to and over the verge of
crotchet. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Cheke: his resolute Anglicism and anti-preciosity.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He was a spelling and pronouncing reformer
both in Greek and English; and, classical
scholar and teacher as he was, he seems to have
fallen in with that curious survival of “Saxon” rendering of
words not of Saxon origin, the great storehouse of which is
the work of Reginald Pecock a century earlier. But he appears
to have been one of the main and most influential
sources of the double stream of tendency observable in Wilson
himself, and still more in Ascham—the tendency on the one
hand to use the classics as models and trainers in the formation
of a generally useful and practicable English style, and
on the other to insist that neither from classical nor from
any other sources should English be adulterated by “inkhorn
terms,” as Wilson calls them,<a id='r209'></a><a href='#f209' class='c019'><sup>[209]</sup></a> of any kind—that is to say, by
archaisms, technicalities, preciousnesses, fished up as it were
from the bottom of the ink-pot, instead of simply and naturally
taken as they came from its surface to the pen. What Ascham
tells us that he said of Sallust is the spirit, the centre, the
kernel, of the criticism of the whole school—a dread that is
to say, and a dislike and a censure of what he calls the “uncontented
care to write better than he could.”<a id='r210'></a><a href='#f210' class='c019'><sup>[210]</sup></a> And it must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>be obvious that this sharply formulated censure is itself a
critical <span lang="fr"><i>point de repère</i></span> of the greatest value. It is well that
it was not too much listened to—for the greatest results of
English prose and verse in the great period, beginning a few
years after Cheke’s death and continuing for an old man’s
lifetime, were the result of this “never contented care,” which
still reached something better than content. But if, at this
early period, it had had too much way given to it, if the vigorous
but somewhat sprawling infancy of Elizabethan English
had been bid and let sprawl simply at its pleasure, the consequences
could not but have been disastrous.</p>

<p class='c000'>This criticism of Sallust, which may be found at length in
Ascham’s <cite>Schoolmaster</cite>,<a id='r211'></a><a href='#f211' class='c019'><sup>[211]</sup></a> is quite a <span lang="la"><i>locus</i></span> in its kind. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His criticism of Sallust.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It is not
of the justest, for the prepossession of the sentence
quoted above (which stands in the forefront of it)
colours it all through. It has funny little scholastic lapses in
logic, such as the attempt to apply the old brocard <span lang="la"><cite>Orator est
vir bonus dicendi peritus</cite></span> to the disadvantage of Sallust, as compared
not only with Cicero but with Cæsar, on the score of
morality. It would have been pleasant to observe the countenances
of Fausta and Servilia if this had been argued in their
joint presence. And the dislike of Thucydides, to which a
disliker of Sallust is almost necessarily driven, argues a literary
palate not of the most refined. But the disposition of the
supposed causes of the faults of Sallust’s style, when, having
sown his wild oats, he took to literature, and borrowed his
vocabulary from Cato and Varro, and his method from Thucydides
himself, is an exceedingly ingenious piece of critical
pleading. Even if it will not hold water, it shows us a stage
of criticism advanced, in some directions, beyond anything that
classical or mediæval times can show. The other great “place”
of Cheke’s writing occurs in his letter<a id='r212'></a><a href='#f212' class='c019'><sup>[212]</sup></a> to Hoby on that learned
knight’s translation of Castiglione, with its solemn judgment
(the author, though but in middle age, was ill, and in fact
almost dying), “I am of this opinion, that our own tongue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>should be written clean and pure, unmixed and unmangled
with borrowing of other tongues, wherein if we take no heed
betimes, ever borrowing and never paying, she shall be fain to
keep house as a bankrupt.” The analogy, of course, is a false
one:—there is no need to pay, nor possibility of payment, any
more than a conquering monarchy needs to fear the repayment
of the tribute it draws from others, or than a sturdy plant
need dread bankruptcy because it owes nourishment to earth,
and air, and the rain of heaven. But once more the position
is a definite, and not a wholly untenable, critical position: and
Cheke shows himself here as at once engineer and captain of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chief representative of this school is, however, beyond
question, the always agreeable, and but seldom other than
admirable, author of <span lang="la"><cite>Toxophilus</cite></span> and <cite>The Schoolmaster</cite>
himself.<a id='r213'></a><a href='#f213' class='c019'><sup>[213]</sup></a> <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Ascham.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> His positive achievements in English
literature do not here directly concern us; nor does the
debate between those who regard him as a Euphuist before
Euphuism, and those who will have him to be the chief example
of the plain style in early Elizabethan literature. I
confess myself to be on the side of the latter; though I know
what the former mean. But it is with what Ascham thought
as a critic, not with what he did as a writer, that we are here
busy; and on this there is no reasonable opening for serious
difference of opinion. Ascham’s critical position and opinions
are clear, not only from his two famous and pleasant little
books, but from the constant literary references in his letters,
ranging from elaborate lucubrations on the study of the classics
to an amusing little Cambridge fling at the older university,
where, as we learn from a letter of exactly the middle of the
century, taste was in so shocking a condition that Oxford men
actually paid more attention to Lucian and Apuleius than to
Cicero and Xenophon.<a id='r214'></a><a href='#f214' class='c019'><sup>[214]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>His patriotism.</i></div>
<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>The <span lang="la"><cite>Toxophilus</cite></span> itself is a critical document in parts, both for
the initial manifesto of his desire “to write this English matter
in the English tongue for English men,” and for the
more elaborate defence of the proceeding (a defence
repeated in the numerous Latin letters accompanying the copies
of the book he sent to his friends), as well as for one of those
hits at Romance which were characteristic of Renaissance
scholars too generally, and were particularly to be expected in
very moral and rather prosaic persons like Ascham. But we
necessarily turn to the <cite>Schoolmaster</cite> for a full exposition of
Ascham’s critical <em>ethos</em>, and we find it.</p>

<p class='c000'>A tendency rather to slight poetry, one great heresy concerning
it (of which more presently), and the above-mentioned
contempt or even horror of romance—these are
the worst things to be noted here. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His horror of Romance</i>,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> All these are
connected with a wider critical heresy, which is prevalent in
England to this day, and which emerges most interestingly in
this infancy of English criticism. This heresy is the valuing of
examples, and even of whole kinds, of literary art, not according
to their perfection on their own artistic standards, not according
to the quantity or quality of artistic pleasure which they are
fitted to give; but according to certain principles—patriotic,
political, ethical, or theological—which the critic holds or does
not hold, as the case may be. This fallacy being one of those
proper—or, at least, inseparably accidental—to the human intellect,
is of course perceptible enough in antiquity itself. It is,
as we have seen, rife in Plato, and more rife in Plutarch; and
there is no doubt that the devotion of the Renaissance to the
greatest of Greek philosophers and prosemen, to the most entertaining
of Greek biographers and moralists, had not a little to do
with its reappearance, though the struggle of the Reformation,
and the national jealousies which this struggle bred or helped,
had more. But no one has given more notable examples of it
than Ascham by his attack on “books of feigned chivalry,” in
<span lang="la"><cite>Toxophilus</cite></span>,<a id='r215'></a><a href='#f215' class='c019'><sup>[215]</sup></a> and his well-known censure of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Morte d’Arthur</cite></span>
in <cite>The Schoolmaster</cite>.<a id='r216'></a><a href='#f216' class='c019'><sup>[216]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>Than this book there was, at Ascham’s date, no more exquisite
example of English prose in existence. There is not to this day
a book, either in prose or in verse, which has more
of the true Romantic charm. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>and of the</i> Morte d’Arthur.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> There are few better
instances anywhere of subtly combined construction
of story than are to be found in some of its parts; and, to a
catholic judgment, which busies itself with the matter and spirit
of a book, there are few books which teach a nobler temper of
mind, which inculcate with a more wonderful blending of sternness
and sympathy the great moral that “the doer shall suffer,”
that “for all these things God shall bring us into judgment,”
or which display more accomplished patterns of man and
sweeter examples of woman. Yet Ascham (and he had read
the book) saw in it nothing but “open manslaughter and
bold bawdry.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Apart from this somewhat Philistine prudery—which occupies
itself more reasonably with Italian <span lang="fr"><i>novelle</i></span>, and the
translations of them into English—Ascham’s criticism is of a
piece with that of the whole school in all but a very few points.
He differed with Wilson, and with most of the scholars of his
time, on the subject of translation, which he rightly enough
regarded as a useful engine of education, but as quite incapable
of giving any literary equivalent for the original. He agreed
both with Wilson and with Cheke as to the impropriety of
adulterating English with any foreign tongue, ancient or
modern. He was, all the same, an exceedingly fervent Ciceronian
and devotee of the golden age of Latin. And when we
come in one<a id='r217'></a><a href='#f217' class='c019'><sup>[217]</sup></a> of his letters to Sturm on the name of Pigna (<i>v.
supra</i>, p. <a href='#Page_62'>62</a>), the rival of Cinthio Giraldi, there seems to be
established a contact, of the most interesting, between English
and Italian criticism. But (as indeed we might have expected)
no allusion to Pigna’s view of the despised romances is even
hinted: it is his dealing with the <span lang="la"><i>aureolum libellum</i></span> of Horace
that Ascham has read, his dealings with Aristotle and Sophocles
that he wishes to read.</p>

<p class='c000'>Putting his theory and his practice together, and neglecting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>for the moment his moral “craze,” we can perceive in him a
tolerably distinct ideal of English prose, which he
has only not illustrated by actual criticism of the
reviewing sort, because the material was so scanty.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His general critical attitude to Prose</i>,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> This prose is to be fashioned with what may be excusably called
a kind of squint—looking partly at Latin and Greek construction
and partly at English vernacular usage. It does not seem
that, great as was his reverence for Cheke, he was bitten by
Cheke’s mania for absolute Teutonism; nor does he appear to
have gone to the extreme of Latimer and Latimer’s admirer,
Wilson, in caring to mingle merely familiar speech with his
ordered vernacular. But he went some way in this direction: he
was by no means proof against that Delilah of alliteration which,
like a sort of fetch or ghost of the older alliterative prosody,
bewitched the mid-sixteenth-century verse and prose of England,
and had not lost hold on Spenser himself. And he had
belief in certain simple Figures of the antithetic and parallel
kind. But he was, above all, a schoolmaster—as even being
dead he spoke—to English literature; and his example and his
precepts together tended to establish a chastened, moderately
classical, pattern of writing, which in the next generation produced
the admirable English prose of Hooker, and was not
without influence on the less accomplished, but more germinal
and protreptic, style of Jonson.</p>

<p class='c000'>We must praise him less when we come to poetry. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>and to Poetry.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The
history of the craze for classical metre and against rhyme in
England, which practically supplies our earliest subject
of purely critical debate, is a very curious one,
and may—perhaps must—be considered from more points of
view than one, before it is rightly and completely understood.
At first sight it looks like mere mid-summer madness—the
work of some Puck of literature—if not even as the incursion
into the calm domains of scholarship and criticism of that
popular <span lang="la"><i>delirium tremens</i></span>, which has been often illustrated in
politics. Shifting of the standpoint, and more careful consideration,
will discover some excuses for it, as well as much
method in it. But it must be regarded long, and examined
carefully, before the real fact is discovered—the fact that,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>mischievous and absurd as it was in itself, unpardonable as
are the attempts to revive it, or something like it, at this time
of day, it was in its own day a kind of beneficent “distemper”—a
necessary, if morbid, stage in the development of English
prosody and English criticism.</p>

<p class='c000'>Inasmuch as the most obvious and indubitable, as well as
universal, cause of the craze was the profound Renaissance
admiration for the classics, it was inevitable that
something of the kind should make its appearance
in most European countries. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The craze for Classical Metres.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But other and counteracting
causes prevented it from assuming, in any of them,
anything like the importance that it attained in England.
Unrhymed classical metres, like almost every literary innovation
of the time, had been first attempted in Italy;<a id='r218'></a><a href='#f218' class='c019'><sup>[218]</sup></a> but
the established and impregnable supremacy of forms like the
Sonnet, the Canzone, the <span lang="it"><cite>ottava</cite></span> and <span lang="it"><cite>terza rima</cite></span>, put rhyme out
of real danger there. They were attempted in France.<a id='r219'></a><a href='#f219' class='c019'><sup>[219]</sup></a> But
French had for centuries possessed a perfectly well-defined
system of prosody, adapted and adequate to the needs and
nature of the language. And, moreover, the singularly <em>atonic</em>
quality of this language, its want not only of the remotest
approach to quantity but even of any decided accent, made
the experiment not merely ridiculous, as indeed it mostly was
in English, but all but impossible. Spanish was following
Italian, and did not want to follow anything else: and German
was not in case to compete.</p>

<p class='c000'>With English the patient was very much more predisposed
to the disease. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Special wants of English Prosody.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Not only two, but practically three, different
systems of prosody, which were really to some extent
opposed to each other, and might well seem more opposed
than they actually were, disputed, in practice,
the not too fertile or flourishing field of English
poetry. There was the true Chaucerian system of blended English
prosody, the legitimate representative of the same composite
influences which have moulded English language, and which
had been slowly developed through the half-chaotic beginnings
of Middle English verse, and then with almost premature suddenness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>perfected up to a certain stage by Chaucer himself.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Its kinds:</i> (1)<i>Chaucerian.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> This system combined—though not yet in perfect freedom—the
strict syllabic foot-division of the French with
the syllabic licence of Anglo-Saxon, so as to produce
a system of syllabic equivalence similar in nature
to, if not yet fully in practice freer than, that of the Greek
Iambic trimeter. It admitted a considerable variety of metres,
the base-integers of which were the octosyllable and decasyllable,
with lines of six, twelve, and others occasionally, combined
in pairs or arranged in stanzas of more or less intricate
forms. But—by a historic accident which has even yet to be
rather taken as found than fully explained—nobody for more
than a hundred years had been able to produce really good
regular<a id='r220'></a><a href='#f220' class='c019'><sup>[220]</sup></a> poetry in Southern English by this metre, and certain
changes in pronunciation and vocabulary—especially the disuse
of the final vocalised <em>e</em>—were putting greater and greater
difficulties in the way of its practice.</p>

<p class='c000'>Secondly, there was the revived alliterative metre, either
genuine—that is to say, only roughly syllabic and not rhymed,
but rhythmed nearer to the anapæstic form than to
any other—or allied with rhyme, and sometimes
formed into stanzas of very considerable intricacy. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>(2) Alliterative.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> This,
which had arisen during the fourteenth century, no one
quite knows how or where, apparently in the North, and
which had maintained a vigorous though rather artificial
life during the fifteenth, had not wholly died out, being represented
partly by the ballad metre, by doggerel twelves,
fourteeners, and other long shambling lines, and by a still
lively tendency towards alliteration itself, both in metred
verse and in prose. Latterly, during Ascham’s own youth,
a sort of <span lang="fr"><i>rapprochement</i></span> between these two had made the
fourteeners and Alexandrines, rather less doggerelised, very
general favourites; but had only managed to communicate to
them a sort of lolloping amble, very grievous and sickening to
the delicate ear.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(3) <i>Italianated.</i></div>

<p class='c000'>Thirdly, and in close connection with this combination,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>Wyatt, Surrey, and other poets had, by imitating Italian
models, especially in the sonnet, striven to raise, to
bind together, to infuse with energy and stiffen with
backbone, the ungainly shambling body of English verse: and
Surrey, again following the Italians, had tried, with some success,
the unrhymed decasyllable soon to be so famous as blank
verse.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now critical observation at the time might survey this field
with view as extensive and intensive as it could apply, and be
far from satisfied with the crops produced. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Deficiencies of all three.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> To represent
the first system there was nobody but
Chaucer, who, great and greatly admired as he was, was
separated from the men of 1550 by a period of time almost
as long as that which separates us from Pope, and by a much
greater gulf of pronunciation and accent. Nobody could write
like Chaucer—unless the Chaucerian <span lang="fr"><cite>Chorizontes</cite></span> are right in
attributing <cite>The Court of Love</cite> to this time, in which case there
was some one who could write very much like Chaucer indeed.
There was no Langland, and nobody who could write in the
least like Langland. In sheer despair, men of talent like
Skelton, when they were not Chaucerising heavily, were
indulging (of course with more dulcet intervals now and then)
in mere wild gambades of doggerel.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it will be said, Was there not the new Italianated style
of poets of such promise as Wyatt and Surrey? There was.
Yet it must be remembered that Wyatt and Surrey themselves
are, after all, poets of more promise than performance; that
their promise itself looks much more promising to us, seeing
as we do its fulfilment in Spenser and onward, than it need
have done, or indeed could do, to contemporaries; that stalwart
Protestants and stout Englishmen feared and loathed the
Italianation of anything English; and lastly, that even the
prosody of Wyatt and Surrey is, in a very high degree, experimental,
tentative, incomplete. We laugh, or are disgusted, at
the twists and tortures applied by the hexametrists to our poor
mother tongue; but Wyatt at least puts almost as awkward
constraints on her.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not surprising that in the presence of these unsatisfying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>things, and in the nonage of catholic literary criticism, men
should have turned for help to those classics which
were the general teachers and helpers of the time.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The temptations of Criticism in this respect.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> There was indeed—already published just as Ascham
had attained his year of discretion—a treatise, by
the greatest man of letters for some fifteen hundred years
at least, which contained the germ of a warning. But it is
not likely that Ascham or any of his good Cambridge friends
had seen Trissino’s translation of the <span lang="la"><cite>De Vulgari Eloquio</cite></span>; and, if
any had, it would have been a stroke of genius to carry Dante’s
generalisation from the Romance tongues further. To almost any
man of the Renaissance it would have seemed half sacrilege and
half madness to examine ancient and modern literatures on the
same plane, and decide what was germane to each and what
common to all. Greek Prosody had been good enough, with
very minor alterations, for Latin; how should any of these
upstart modern tongues refuse what had been good enough for
both? And let it be remembered, too, that they were only half
wrong. Greek and Latin <em>did</em> provide up to a certain point—that
of the foot as distinguished from the metre—examples
which, duly guarded, could be quite safely followed, which
indeed could not and cannot be neglected without loss and
danger for English. It was when they went further, and
endeavoured to impose the classical combinations of feet on
English, that they fell.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet even from the first they had glimpses and glimmerings
of truth which might have warned them; while in
their very errors they often display that combination
of independence and practical spirit which is the
too often undervalued glory of English criticism.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Its adventurers: Ascham himself.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Ascham himself—besotted as he is with wrath<a id='r221'></a><a href='#f221' class='c019'><sup>[221]</sup></a> against “our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>rude beggarly rhyming,” confident as he is that the doggerel of
his old friend Bishop Watson of Lincoln—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“All travellers do gladly report great praise of Ulysses,</div>
      <div class='line'>For that he knew many men’s manners, and saw many cities,”—</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>exhibits<a id='r222'></a><a href='#f222' class='c019'><sup>[222]</sup></a> as “right quantitie” of syllables and true order of
versifying as either Greek or Latin—yet saw<a id='r223'></a><a href='#f223' class='c019'><sup>[223]</sup></a> that “our English
tongue doth not well receive the nature of <span lang="la"><cite>Carmen Heroicum</cite></span>,
because <span lang="la"><i>dactylus</i></span>, the aptest foot for that verse, is seldom found
in English.” Truly it is not; your dactyl is apt to play the
“Waler”—to buck under an English rider, and either throw
him altogether, or force the alteration of the pace to anapæsts.
The best apparent dactylics in English—the verses of Kingsley’s
<cite>Andromeda</cite>—are not really dactylic-hexameters at all, they are
five-foot anapæstics, with a very strong <span lang="la"><i>anacrusis</i></span> at the beginning,
and a weak hypercatalectic syllable at the end. And
with this fatal confession of Ascham (who had not a very
poetical head), that of Campion, an exquisite poet and a keen
though warped critic, coincides, as we shall see, a generation
later. But the thing had to be done; and it was done, or at
least attempted.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the craze first took form in England we do not exactly
know. Ascham observes vaguely that “this misliking of rhyming
beginneth not now of any newfangle singularity,
but hath been long been misliked, and that of men
of greatest learning and deepest judgment.”<a id='r224'></a><a href='#f224' class='c019'><sup>[224]</sup></a> <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Watson and Drant.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> We all think that
the persons who agree with us are men of great learning and deep
judgment, so that matter may be passed over. But apparently
the thing was one, and not the best, of the fruits of that study
of the classics, and specially of Greek, which, beginning at
Oxford, passed thence to Cambridge, and was taken up so
busily in Ascham’s own college, St John’s. Thomas Watson,<a id='r225'></a><a href='#f225' class='c019'><sup>[225]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>the Bishop of Lincoln, above referred to, was Master of the
College; Ascham himself, it is hardly necessary to say, was a
fellow of it. And still descending in the collegiate hierarchy, it
was an undergraduate of St John’s, Thomas Drant, who somewhat
later drew up rules for Anglo-Classic versifying—rules
that occupied Spenser and Harvey, with the result of producing
some interesting letters and some very deplorable doggerel.
Drant seems to have been the “legislator of Parnassus” to the
innovators; but we have little work of his, and that little does
not bear on the special subject.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mischievous craze as it was, however,<a id='r226'></a><a href='#f226' class='c019'><sup>[226]</sup></a> it had the merit of
turning the attention of Englishmen to really critical study of
poetry, and it appears, more or less, as the <span lang="fr"><i>motif</i></span> of most of the
group of critical writings, from Gascoigne’s <cite>Notes of Instruction</cite>
to Daniel’s <cite>Defence of Rhyme</cite>, which we shall now discuss.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the most interesting little treatise<a id='r227'></a><a href='#f227' class='c019'><sup>[227]</sup></a> which heads or initials<a id='r228'></a><a href='#f228' class='c019'><sup>[228]</sup></a>
the now goodly roll of books in English criticism, George
Gascoigne, though he was himself a Cambridge man,
does not make any reference to the craze. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Gascoigne.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The tract
was written at the request of an Italian friend, Eduardo
Donati. It is exceedingly short; but as full of matter, and very
good matter, as need be. In duty bound Gascoigne begins with
insistence on fine invention, without which neither “thundering
in rym ram ruff, quoth my master Chaucer,” nor “rolling in
pleasant words,” nor “abounding in apt vocables,” will suffice.
But he passes over this very swiftly, as over trite and obvious
expressions,<a id='r229'></a><a href='#f229' class='c019'><sup>[229]</sup></a> suitableness of phrase, &#38;c., and attacks the great
literary question of the time, Prosody.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>He begins his attack by the modest and half-apologetic
request, “This may seem a presumptuous order,” that, whatever
the verse chosen be, it be regular, and not
wobbling backwards and forwards between twelve
and fourteen syllables on no principle. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His</i> Notes of Instruction.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Then he enjoins
the maintenance of regular and usual accent or quantity;
and in so doing insists on a standard in regard to which
not merely Wyatt and Surrey earlier, but even Spenser later,
were much less scrupulous. “Treasure,” he says, you must
use with the first syllable long and the second short: you
must not make it “treasùre.” And then he makes a very
curious observation:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Commonly nowadays in English rhymes, for I dare not call
them English verses, we use none other order but a foot of
two syllables,” to wit, the Iamb. “We have,” he says, “in
other times used other kinds of metres,” as</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"No wight | in the world | that wealth | can attain,"<a id='r230'></a><a href='#f230' class='c019'><sup>[230]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>(<i>i.e.</i>, anapæsts), while “our Father Chaucer had used the same
liberty in feet and measures that the Latinists do use,” that is to
say, syllabic equivalence of two shorts to a long. And he
laments the tyranny of the Iamb; but says, “we must take the
ford as we find it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, after some particular cautions,—a renewed one as to
quantifying words aright—“understànd,” not “undérstand,”
&#38;c., as to using as many monosyllables as possible (it is amusing
to read this and remember the opposite caution of Pope),—he
comes to rhyme, and warns his scholar against rhyme without
reason. Alliteration is to be moderate: you must not “hunt a
letter to death.” Unusual words are to be employed carefully
and with a definite purpose to “draw attentive reading.” Be
clear and sensible.<a id='r231'></a><a href='#f231' class='c019'><sup>[231]</sup></a> Keep English order, and invert substantive
and adjective seldom and cautiously. Be moderate in the use
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>also of that “shrewd fellow, poetical licence,” who actually reads
"hea|ven" for "heavn"!<a id='r232'></a><a href='#f232' class='c019'><sup>[232]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>As for the pause or Cæsura, Gascoigne is not injudicious.
“The pause,” he says, “will stand best in the middle” of an
octosyllable, at the fourth syllable in a “verse of ten,” at the
sixth (or middle again) of an Alexandrine, and at the eighth
in a fourteener. But it is at the discretion of the writer
in Rhythm royal: “it forceth not where the pause be till
the end of the line”—and this liberty will assuredly draw
to more.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next he enumerates stanzas:—Rhyme royal itself, ballades,
sonnets, Dizains, and Sixains, Virelays, and the “Poulter’s
measure,” of twelve and fourteen alternately, to which his own
contemporaries were so unfortunately addicted. You must
“finish the sentence and meaning at the end of every staff”: and
(by the way) he has “forgotten a notable kind of rhyme called
riding rhyme, which is what our father Chaucer used in his
Canterbury tales, and in divers other delectable and light enterprises.”
It is good for “a merry tale,” Rhyme royal for a
“grave discourse,” Ballads and Sonnets for love-poems, &#38;c., and
it would be best, in his judgment, to keep Poulter’s measure for
Psalms and hymns. And so he makes an end, “doubting his
own ignorance.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The chief points about this really capital booklet are as
follows:—Gascoigne’s recognition of the importance of overhauling
English Prosody; his good sense on the matter of
the cæsura, and of Chaucer’s adoption of the principles
of equivalenced scansion; his acknowledgment with regret
of the impoverishment which, in the sterility of the mid-sixteenth
century before Spenser, was a fact, as resulting from the
tyranny of the iamb; the shrewdness of his general remarks;
and, last but not least, his entire silence about the new versifying,
the “Dranting of Verses.” <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Their capital value.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It is possible (for though
he was at Cambridge he seems to admit that he did not acquire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>any great scholarship there) that he had not come into contact
with any one who took interest in this: but it is improbable
that it would have appealed to his robust sense of poetry,
unsicklied by Harvey’s pedantry, and not misled by Spenser’s
classical enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this time, however, or not long after—the <cite>Notes</cite> must have
been written between 1572 and 1575, and the correspondence of
Spenser and Harvey actually appeared in 1579—these other
persons were thinking a great deal about the classical metres.
The <cite>Five Letters</cite> (“Three” and “Two”<a id='r233'></a><a href='#f233' class='c019'><sup>[233]</sup></a>—not to be confused
with the <cite>Four Letters</cite> which Harvey issued long afterwards
about Greene) are full of the subject, and of poetical criticism
generally. They, together with the controversy which arose
over Gosson’s <cite>School of Abuse</cite>, and which indirectly produced
Sidney’s <cite>Apology for Poetry</cite>, make the years 1579-1580 as
notable in the history of English criticism as the appearances
of <cite>Euphues</cite> and <cite>The Shepherd’s Calendar</cite> make them in that of
creative literature.</p>

<p class='c000'>Spenser’s first letter informs Harvey that “they [Sidney
and Dyer] have proclaimed in their ἀρειωπάγῳ<a id='r234'></a><a href='#f234' class='c019'><sup>[234]</sup></a> [the literary
<span lang="fr"><i>cénacle</i></span> of Leicester House] a general surceasing and
silence of bald rhymers, and also of the very best
too: instead whereof they have, by the authority of their
whole Senate, prescribed certain laws and rules of quantities
of English syllables for English verse, having had thereof
already great practice, and drawn me to their faction.” <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Spenser and Harvey.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> And
later, “I am more in love with English versifying than with
rhyming, which I should have done long since if I would have
followed your counsel.” He hints, however, gently, that
Harvey’s own verses (these coterie writers always keep the
name “verses” for their hybrid abortions) once or twice “make
a breach in Master Drant’s rules.” Which was, of course, a
very dreadful thing, only to be “condoned <span lang="la"><i>tanto poetæ</i></span>.” He
requites Harvey with a few Iambics, which he “dare
warrant precisely perfect for the feet, and varying not one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>inch from the Rule.” And then follows the well-known piece
beginning—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Unhappy verse, the witness of my unhappy state,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>where certainly the state must have been bad if it was as
infelicitous as the verse.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not such was Gabriel Harvey that he might take even a
polite correction; and his reply is a proper donnish setting-down
of a clever but presumptuous youth. He respects the
Areopagus—indeed they were persons of worship, and Harvey
was a <span lang="fr"><i>roturier</i></span>—more than Spenser can or will suppose, and he
likes the trimeters (indeed, though poor things, they were
Spenser’s own after all, and such as no man but Spenser could
have written in their foolish kind) more than Spenser “can or
will easily believe.” But—and then follows much reviewing
in the now stale hole-picking kind, which has long been abandoned,
save by the descendants of Milbourne and Kenrick, and
a lofty protestation that “myself never saw your gorbellied
master’s rules, nor heard of them before.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Three Letters which follow<a id='r235'></a><a href='#f235' class='c019'><sup>[235]</sup></a> are distributed in subject
between an Earthquake (which has long since ceased to quake
for us) and the hexameters. They open with a letter from
Spenser, in which he broaches the main question, “Whether
our English accent will endure the Hexameter?” and doubts.
Yet he has a hankering after it, encloses his own—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“See ye the blindfoldèd pretty god, that feathered archer,” &#38;c.,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>and prays that Harvey would either follow the rules of the
great Drant, indorsed by Sidney, or else send his own. Harvey
replies in double. The first part is some very tragical mirth
about the earthquake; the second, “A Gallant Familiar Letter,”
tackles the question of versification.</p>

<p class='c000'>This gallant familiarity might possibly receive from harsh
critics the name of uneasy coxcombry; but it is at any rate
clear that the author has set about the matter very seriously.
He expresses delight that Sidney and Dyer, “the two very
diamonds of her Majesty’s Court,” have begun to help forward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>“the exchange of barbarous and balductum<a id='r236'></a><a href='#f236' class='c019'><sup>[236]</sup></a> rhymes with
artificial verses”; thinks their “lively example” will be much
better than Ascham’s “dead advertisement” in the <cite>Schoolmaster</cite>.
He would like (as should we) to have Drant’s prosody. His
own Rules and Precepts will probably not be very different;
but he will take time before drafting them finally. He thinks
(reasonably enough) that before framing a standard English
Grammar or Rhetoric (therein including Prosody), a standard
orthography must first be agreed upon. And he suggests that
“we beginners” (this from the author of these truly “barbarous
and balductum” antics to the author of the <cite>Faerie Queene</cite> is
distinctly precious) have the advantage, like Homer and
Ennius, of setting examples. “A New Year’s Gift to M.
George Bilchaunger,” in very doleful hexameters, follows, and
after a little gird at Spenser’s “See ye the Blindfoldèd,” another
sprout of Harvey’s brain in the same kind, which has been,
perhaps, more, and more deservedly, laughed at than any of
these absurdities, except the scarcely sane jargon-doggerel of
Stanyhurst—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“What might I call this tree? a Laurell? o bonny Laurell!</div>
      <div class='line'>Needs to thy boughs will I bow this knee, and veil my bonetto;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>with yet another—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Since <em>Galateo</em><a id='r237'></a><a href='#f237' class='c019'><sup>[237]</sup></a> came in, and Tuscanism gan usurp.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>He thinks that the author of this last “wanted but some
delicate choice elegant poesy” of Sidney’s or Dyer’s for a good
pattern. After some further experiments of his own, or his
brother’s, in hexametring some of Spenser’s own “emblems”
in the <cite>Calendar</cite>, he turns to Spenser himself, whom, it seems,
he ranks next the same “incomparable and miraculous genius
in the catalogue of our very principal English Aristarchi.” He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>proceeds to speak of some of that earlier work which, as in
<cite>The Dying Pelican</cite>, is certainly, or in the <cite>Dreams</cite>, possibly, lost.
After which he writes himself down for all time in the famous
passage about the <cite>Faerie Queene</cite>, which he had “once again
nigh forgotten,” but which he now sends home “in neither
better nor worse case than he found her.” “As for his judgment,”
he is “void of all judgment if Spenser’s <cite>Nine Comedies</cite>
[also lost] are not nearer Ariosto’s than that Elvish Queene is
to the <cite>Orlando</cite>, which” Spenser “seems to emulate, and hopes
to overgo.” And so he ends his paragraph with the yet more
famous words, “If so be the <cite>Faery Queene</cite> be fairer in your eye
than the Nine Muses, and Hobgoblin run away with the
garland from Apollo, mark what I say, and yet I will not say
what I thought, but there an end for this once, and fare you
well till God or some good Angel put you in a better mind!”
Which words let all who practise criticism grave in their
memories, and recite them daily, adding, “Here, but for the
grace of God——!” if they be modest and fear Nemesis.</p>

<p class='c000'>After an interval, however, Harvey returns to actual
criticism, and shows himself in rather better figure by protesting,
in spite of “five hundred Drants,” against the alteration
of the quantity of English words by accenting “Majesty”
and “Manfully,” and “Carpenter” on the second syllable.
And he falls in with Gascoigne on the subject of such words
as “Heaven.” Nor could he, even if he had been far less of a
pedant and coxcomb, have given better or sounder doctrine
than that with which he winds up. “It is the vulgar and
natural mother Prosody, that alone worketh the feat, as the
only supreme foundress and reformer of Position, Diphthong,
Orthography, or whatsoever else; whose affirmatives are

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Puritan attack on Poetry.</i></div>
<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>Meanwhile the strong critical set of the time—so interesting,
if not so satisfying, after the absolute silence of criticism in
English earlier—was being shown in another direction
by a different controversy, to which, as we have
seen, Spenser makes allusion. The points which
chiefly interested him at the moment were formal; those to
which we now come were partly of the same class though
of another species, partly transcending form.</p>

<p class='c000'>Stephen Gosson is one of the persons of whom, as is by
no means always the case, it would really be useful to know
more than we do know about their private history
and character. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Gosson.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> What disgust, what disappointment,
what tardy development of certain strains of temper and disposition
he underwent, we do not know; but something of
the kind there must have been to make a young man of four-and-twenty,
a fair scholar, already of some note for both
dramatic and poetical writing, and obviously of no mean intellectual
powers, swing violently round, and denounce plays,
and poems, and almost literature generally, as the works of
the Devil. It is quite insufficient to ejaculate “Puritanism!”
or “Platonism!” for neither of these was a new thing, and
the question is why Gosson was not affected by them earlier
or later.</p>

<p class='c000'>Let us, however, now as always, abstain from speculation
when we have fact; and here we have at least three very
notable facts—Gosson’s <cite>School of Abuse</cite>,<a id='r239'></a><a href='#f239' class='c019'><sup>[239]</sup></a> with its satellite
tractates, Lodge’s untitled <cite>Reply</cite>,<a id='r240'></a><a href='#f240' class='c019'><sup>[240]</sup></a> and the famous <cite>Defence of
Poesy</cite> or <cite>Apology for Poetry</cite><a id='r241'></a><a href='#f241' class='c019'><sup>[241]</sup></a> which Sidney (to whom Gosson
had rashly dedicated his book) almost certainly intended as a
counterblast, though either out of scorn, as Spenser hints, or
(more probably from what we know of him) out of amiable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>and courteous dislike to requite a compliment with an insult,
he takes no direct notice of Gosson at any time.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>The School of Abuse</cite> (which is written in such a style as
almost to out-Euphuise the contemporary <cite>Euphues</cite> itself) is
critical wholly from the moral side, and with reference
to the actual, not the necessary or possible,
state of poetry. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The School of Abuse.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> There are even, the author says, some good
plays, including at least one of his own; but the whole of
ancient poetry (he says little or nothing of modern) is infected
by the blasphemy and immorality of Paganism, and nearly the
whole of the modern stage is infected by the abuses of the
theatre—of which Gosson speaks in terms pretty well identical
with those which Puritan teachers had for some years past
been using in sermon and treatise. But outside of the moral
and religious line he does not step: he is solely occupied with
the lies and the licence of poets and players.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lodge’s reply (the title-page of it has been lost, but
it <em>may</em> be the <cite>Honest Excuses</cite> to which Gosson refers as
having been published against him) is almost entirely
an appeal to authority, seasoned with a little
personal invective. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Lodge’s</i> Reply.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Lodge strings together all the classical
names he can think of, with a few mediæval, to show that
Poetry, Music (which Gosson had also attacked), and even
the theatre, are not bad things. But he hardly attempts any
independent justification of them as good ones, especially from
the purely literary point of view. In fact, his pamphlet—though
interesting as critical work from the associate of great
creators in drama, himself a delightful minor poet and no
contemptible pioneer of English prose fiction—is merely one
of the earliest adaptations in English of an unreal defence to an
attack, logically as unreal though actually dangerous. The
charlatan-geniuses of the Renaissance, with Cornelius Agrippa<a id='r242'></a><a href='#f242' class='c019'><sup>[242]</sup></a>
at their head, had refurbished the Platonic arguments for the
sincere but pestilent reformers of the Puritan type. Lodge
and his likes, in all countries from Italy outwards and from
Boccaccio downward, accept the measure of the shadowy daggers
of their opponents, and attempt to meet them with weapons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>of similar temper. The only reality of the debate is in its
accidents, not in its main purport. But the assailants, in
England at least, had for the time an unfair advantage, because
the defence could point to no great poet but Chaucer. The
real answer was being provided by one of themselves in the
shape of <cite>The Faerie Queene</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sidney’s book, though pervaded by the same delusion, is one
of far more importance. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Sidney’s</i> Apology for Poetry.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It is not free from faults—in fact, it
has often been pointed out that some of Sidney’s doctrines,
if they had been accepted, would have made
the best efforts of Elizabethan literature abortive.
But the defects of detail, of which more presently, are mixed
with admirable merits; the critic shows himself able, as Gosson
had not been able, to take a wide and catholic, instead of a
peddling and pettifogging, view of morality. Instead of merely
stringing authorities together like Lodge, he uses authority
indeed, but abuses it not; and while not neglecting form he
does not give exclusive attention to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>His main object, indeed (though he does not know it), is the
defence, not so much of Poetry as of Romance. He follows
the ancients in extending the former term to any prose fiction:
but it is quite evident that he would have, in his <em>mimesis</em>, a
quality of imagination which Aristotle nowhere insists upon,
and which is in the best sense Romantic. And of this poetry, or
romance, he makes one of the loftiest conceptions possible.
All the hyperboles of philosophers or of poets, on order, justice,
harmony, and the like, are heaped upon Poetry herself, and all
the Platonic objections to her are retorted or denied.<a id='r243'></a><a href='#f243' class='c019'><sup>[243]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It has been said that there is no direct reference to Gosson
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>in the <cite>Apology</cite>, though the indirect references are fairly clear.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Abstract of it.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Sidney begins (in the orthodox Platonic or Ciceronian
manner) somewhat off his subject, by telling
how the right virtuous Edward Wotton, and he himself, once
at the Emperor’s Court learnt horsemanship of John Pietro
Pugliano, the Imperial Equerry, and recounting with pleasant
irony some magnifying of his office by that officer. Whence,
by an equally pleasant rhetorical turn, he slips into a defence of
<em>his</em> office—his “unelected vocation” of poet. Were not the
earliest and greatest authors of all countries, Musæus, Homer,
Hesiod, in Greece (not to mention Orpheus and Linus), Livius
Andronicus and Ennius among the Romans, Dante, Boccaccio,
and Petrarch in Italy, Chaucer and Gower for “our English”—were
they not all poets? Even the philosophers in Greece used
poetry, and Plato himself is a poet almost against his will.
Herodotus called his nine books after the Muses; and he and
all historians have stolen or usurped things of poetry. Wales,
Ireland, “the most barbarous and simple Indians,” are cited.
Nay, further, did not the Romans call a poet <span lang="la"><i>vates</i></span>, a “prophet”?
and, by presumption, may we not call David’s psalms a divine
poem? Whatever some may think,<a id='r244'></a><a href='#f244' class='c019'><sup>[244]</sup></a> it is no profanation to do
so. For what is a poet? What do we mean by adopting that
Greek title for him? We mean that he is a <em>maker</em>. All other
arts and sciences limit themselves to nature; the poet alone
transcends it, improves it, makes, nay, brings it (“let it not be
deemed too saucy a comparison”) in some sort into competition
with the Creator Himself whom he imitates.</p>

<p class='c000'>The kinds of this imitation are then surveyed—“Divine,”
“Philosophical,” and that of the third or right sort, who only
imitate to invent and improve, which neither divine nor philosophic
poets can do. These classes are subdivided according to
their matter—heroic, tragic, comic, &#38;c.—or according to the
sorts of verses they liked best to write in, “for, indeed, the
greatest part of poets have apparelled their poetical inventions
in that numerous kind of writing which is called verse—indeed
but apparelled, verse being but an ornament and no cause to
poetry.” And again, “it is not rhyming and versing that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>maketh a poet.” Xenophon and Heliodorus were both poets
in prose.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now let us “weigh this latter part of poetry first by works
and then by parts,” having regard always to the “Architectonice
or mistress-knowledge,” the knowledge of a man’s self,
ethically and politically. Philosophy, history, law, &#38;c., are
then “weighed” against poetry at some length: and the judgment
of Aristotle that Poetry is <i>philosophoteron</i> and <i>spoudaioteron</i>
than history, is affirmed chiefly on the odd ground of
poetical justice,—the right always triumphing in poetry though
not in fact. Instances of the moral and political uses of poetry
follow. Then for the parts. Pastoral, comedy, tragedy, &#38;c., are
by turns surveyed and defended; and it is in the eulogy of
lyric that the famous sentence about <cite>Chevy Chase</cite><a id='r245'></a><a href='#f245' class='c019'><sup>[245]</sup></a> occurs.
After this, and after a stately vindication of Poetry’s right to
the laurel, he turns to the objections of the objectors. Although
repeating the declaration that “rhyming and versing make not
poetry,” he argues that if they <em>were</em> inseparable,<a id='r246'></a><a href='#f246' class='c019'><sup>[246]</sup></a> verse is the
most excellent kind of writing, far better than prose. As to
the abuses of poetry, they are but abuses, and do not take away
the use, as is proved by a great number of stock examples.</p>

<p class='c000'>Why, then, has England grown so hard a stepmother to
poets? They are bad enough as a rule, no doubt; though
Chaucer did excellently considering his time. The <cite>Mirror for
Magistrates</cite> is good; so is Surrey; and <cite>The Shepherd’s Calendar</cite>
“hath much poetry,” though “the old rustic language” is bad,
since neither Theocritus, nor Virgil, nor Sannazar has it. And
what is the reason of our inferiority? The neglect of rule.
From this point onwards Sidney certainly “exposes his legs to
the arrows” of those who ignore the just historic estimate. He
pours ridicule on all our tragedies except <cite>Gorboduc</cite>, and still
more on our mongrel tragi-comedies. We must follow the
Unities, which, as it is, are neglected even in <cite>Gorboduc</cite>, “how
much more in all the rest?” Whence he proceeds (unconscious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>how cool the <span lang="la"><i>reductio ad absurdum</i></span> will leave us) to the
famous ridicule of “Asia on the one side and Africa on the
other,” of “three ladies walking to gather flowers,” and how the
same place which was a garden becomes a rock, and then a cave
with a monster, and then a battlefield with two armies—of the
course of two lives in two hours’ space, &#38;c. And he concludes
with some remarks on versification, which we should gladly
have seen worked out. For he does not now seem to be in that
antagonistic mood towards rhyme which Spenser’s letters to
Harvey discover in him. On the contrary, he admits <em>two</em>
styles, ancient and modern, the former depending on quantity,
the latter depending on “number,” accent, and rhyme. He
indeed thinks English fit for both sorts, and denies “neither
sweetness nor majesty” to rhyme, but is, like almost all his
contemporaries and followers (except Gascoigne partially), in a
fog as to “numbers” and cæsura. The actual end comes a very
little abruptly by an exhortation of some length, half humorous,
half serious, to all and sundry, to be “no more to jest at the
reverent title of a rhymer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The importance of this manifesto, both symptomatically and
typically, can hardly be exaggerated. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Its minor shortcomings</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It exposes the temper
of the generation which actually produced the first-fruits
of the greatest Elizabethan poetry; it served
as a stimulant and encouragement to all the successive generations
of the great age. That Sidney makes mistakes both in
gross and detail—that he even makes some rather serious mistakes
from the mere “point of view of the examiner”—is of
course undeniable. He has a good deal of the merely traditional
mode of Renaissance respect for classical—and for some
modern—authority. That, for instance, there is a good deal to
be said, and that not only from the point of view of Ben Jonson,
against Spenser’s half-archaic half-rustic dialect in the <cite>Calendar</cite>,
few would refuse to grant. But Theocritus <em>did</em> use dialect: it
would not in the least matter whether either he or Virgil did
not; and if it did, what has the modern and partly vernacular
name of Sannazar to do with the matter? It can only be
replied that Spenser, by permitting “E. K.'s” annotation, did
much to invite this sort of criticism; and that Englishmen’s reluctance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>to rely on the inherent powers of the English language
was partly justified (for hardly any dead poet but Chaucer and
no dead prose-writers but Malory and perhaps Berners deserved
the title of “great”), partly came from very pardonable ignorance.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been already observed that Sidney is by no means
peremptory about the “new versifying”; and in particular has
absolutely none of the craze against rhyme as rhyme which
animated persons of every degree of ability, from Milton to
Stanyhurst, during more than a century. His remarks on versification
are, however, too scanty to need much comment.</p>

<p class='c000'>There remain his two major heresies, the declaration that
verse is not inseparable from poetry, and the denunciation of
tragi-comedy. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>and major heresies.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In both the authority of the ancients
must again bear good part of the blame, but in both
he has additional excuses. As to the “pestilent heresy of prose
poetry,” he is at least not unwilling to argue on the hypothesis
that verse <em>were</em> necessary to poetry, though he does not think it
is. He is quite sure that verse is anyhow a nobler medium
than prose. As for the plays, there is still more excuse for
him. His classical authorities were quite clear on the point;
and as yet there was nothing to be quoted on the other side—at
least in English. Spanish had indeed already made the
experiment of tragi-comic and anti-unitarian treatment; but I
do not think any of the best Spanish examples had yet appeared,
and there is great difference between the two theatres. In
English itself not one single great or even good play certainly
existed on the model at Sidney’s death; and, from what we have
of what did exist, we can judge how the rough verse, the clumsy
construction, or rather absence of construction, the entire absence
of clear character-projection, and the higgledy-piggledy
of huddled horrors and horseplay, must have shocked a taste
delicate in itself and nursed upon classical and Italian literature.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The excuses of both,</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> And it is noteworthy that even <cite>Gorboduc</cite>,
with all its regularity and “Senecation,” does not
bribe Sidney to overlook at least some of its defects. He is
here, as elsewhere,—as indeed throughout,—neither blind nor
bigoted. He is only in the position of a man very imperfectly
supplied with actual experiments and observations, confronted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>with a stage of creative production but just improving from a
very bad state, and relying on old and approved methods as
against new ones which had as yet had no success.</p>

<p class='c000'>And had his mistakes been thrice what they are, the tone
and temper of his tractate would make us forgive them three
times over. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>and their ample compensation.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> That “moving of his heart as with a
trumpet” communicates itself to his reader even
now, and shows us the motion in the heart of the
nation at large that was giving us the <cite>Faerie Queene</cite>, that was
to give us <cite>Hamlet</cite> and <cite>As You Like It</cite>. What though the
illustrations sometimes make us smile? that the praise of the
moral and political effects of poetry may sometimes turn the
smile into a laugh or a sigh? Poetry after all, like all other
human things, has a body and a soul. The body must be
fashioned by art—perhaps the body <em>is</em> art; but the soul is
something else. The best poetry will not come without careful
consideration of form and subject, of kind and style; but it will
not necessarily come with this consideration. There must be
the inspiration, the enthusiasm, the <span lang="la"><i>afflatus</i></span>, the glow; and they
are here in Sidney’s tractate. Nor must we fail to draw attention,
once more, to the difference of the English critical spirit
here shown as regards both Italian and French.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the decade which followed,<a id='r247'></a><a href='#f247' class='c019'><sup>[247]</sup></a> three notable books of English
criticism appeared, none of them exhibiting Sidney’s <span lang="la"><i>afflatus</i></span>, but
all showing the interest felt in the subject, and one
exceeding in method, and at least attempted range,
anything that English had known, or was to know,
for more than a century. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span> <i>King James’s</i> Reulis and Cautelis.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> These were King James the First’s
(as yet only “the Sixth’s”) <cite>Reulis and Cautelis to be observit
and eschewit in Scottis Poesie</cite>, 1585; William Webbe’s <cite>Discourse
of English Poesie</cite>, next year; and the anonymous <cite>Arte of English
Poesie</cite>, which appeared in 1589, and which (on rather weak
evidence, but with no counter-claimant) is usually attributed to
George Puttenham.<a id='r248'></a><a href='#f248' class='c019'><sup>[248]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>The first is the slightest; but it is interesting for more than
its authorship. It was attached to James’s <cite>Essays of a Prentice
in the Divine Art</cite>, of which it gives some rules: it shows that
Buchanan had taken pains with his pupil; and it also exhibits
that slightly scholastic and “peddling,” but by no means unreal,
shrewdness and acumen which distinguished the British
Solomon in his happier moments. It is characteristic that
James is not in the least afraid of the charge of attending to
mint, anise, and cumin. He plunges without any rhetorical
exordium into what he calls “just colours”—do not rhyme on
the same syllable, see that your rhyme is on accented syllables
only, do not let your first or last word exceed two or three
syllables at most. This dread of polysyllables, so curious to us,
was very common at the time: it was one of the things from
which Shakespeare’s silent sovereignty delivered us by such
touches of spell-dissolving mastery as</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The multitudinous seas incarnadine.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Then he passes to feet, of which he practically allows only the
iamb; while he very oddly gives the word “foot” to the syllable,
not the combination of syllables; and lays down the entirely
arbitrary rule that the number of “feet”—<i>i.e.</i>, syllables—must
be even, not odd. There is to be a sharp section (“cæsura”) in
the middle of every line, long or short; and the difference of
long, short, and “indifferent” (common) feet or syllables is dwelt
upon, with its influence of “flowing,” as the King calls rhythm.
Cautions on diction follow, and some against commonplaces,
which look as if the royal prentice had read Gascoigne, a suggestion
confirmed elsewhere.<a id='r249'></a><a href='#f249' class='c019'><sup>[249]</sup></a> Invention is briefly touched; and the
tract finishes with a short account of the kinds of verse: “rhyme”—<i>i.e.</i>,
the heroic couplet, “quhilk servis onely for lang historieis”;
a heroical stanza of nine lines, rhymed <i>aabaabbab</i>; <span lang="it"><i>ottava rima</i></span>,
which he calls “ballat royal”; rhyme royal, which he calls
“Troilus verse”; “rouncifals,” or “tumbling verse” (doggerel
alliterative, with bob and wheel); sonnets; “common” verse
(octosyllable couplets); “all kinds of broken or cuttit verse,” &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c000'>The tract is, as has been said, interesting, because it is an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>honest, and by no means unintelligent, attempt to make an
English prosody, with special reference to a dialect which had
done great things in its short day, but which had been specially
affected—not to say specially disorganised—by the revived and
bastard alliteration of the fifteenth century. Probably it was
the study of French (where the iamb had long been the
only foot) which, quite as much as mere following of Gascoigne,
induced James to extend that crippling limitation to
English; and the same influence may be seen in his insistence
on the hard-and-fast section. These things (the latter of
which at least rather endeared him to Dr Guest)<a id='r250'></a><a href='#f250' class='c019'><sup>[250]</sup></a> are, of course,
quite wrong; but they express the genuine and creditable
desire of the time to impose some order on the shambling
doggerel of the generation or two immediately preceding. We
find the same tendency even in Spenser, as far as rigid dissyllabic
feet and sections are concerned; and it is certainly
no shame for the Royal prentice to follow, though unknowing,
the master and king of English poetry at the time when
he wrote.</p>

<p class='c000'>One would not, however, in any case have expected from
James evidence of the root of the matter in poetry. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Webbe’s</i> Discourse.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> There is
more of this root, though less scholarship and also
more “craze,” in the obscure William Webbe, of
whom we know practically nothing except that he was a Cambridge
man, a friend of Robert Wilmot (the author of <cite>Tancred
and Gismund</cite>) and private tutor to the sons of Edward Sulyard
of Flemyngs, an Essex squire. The young Sulyards must have
received some rather dubious instruction in the classics, for
Webbe, in his inevitable classical exordium, thinks that Pindar
was older than Homer, and that Horace came after—apparently
a good while after—Ovid, and about the same time as Juvenal
and Persius. He was, however, really and deeply interested in
English verse; and his enthusiasm for Spenser—“the new
poet,” “our late famous poet,” “the mightiest English poet that
ever lived,” is, if not in every case quite according to knowledge,
absolutely right on the whole, and very pleasant and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>refreshing to read. It is, indeed, the first thing of the kind
that we meet with in English; for the frequent earlier praises
of Chaucer are almost always long after date, always uncritical,
and for the most part<a id='r251'></a><a href='#f251' class='c019'><sup>[251]</sup></a> much rather expressions of a conventional
tradition than of the writer’s deliberate preference.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was Webbe’s misfortune, rather than his fault, that, like
his idol (but without that idol’s resipiscence), and, like most
loyal Cambridge men, with the examples of Watson, Ascham,
and Drant before them, he was bitten with “the new versifying.”
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Slight in knowledge,</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It was rather his fault than his misfortune that he seems
to have taken very little pains to acquaint himself with the
actual performance of English poetry. Even of Gower he
speaks as though he only knew him through the references of
Chaucer and others: though three editions of the <span lang="la"><cite>Confessio</cite></span>—Caxton’s
one and Berthelette’s two—were in print in his time.
His notice of Chaucer himself is curiously vague, and almost
limited to his powers as a satirist, while he has, what must
seem to most judges,<a id='r252'></a><a href='#f252' class='c019'><sup>[252]</sup></a> the astonishing idea of discovering “good
proportion of verse and meetly current style” in Lydgate,
though he reproves him for dealing with “superstitious and odd
matters.” That he thinks <cite>Piers Plowman</cite> later than Lydgate
is unlucky, but not quite criminal. He had evidently read it—indeed
the book, from its kinship in parts to the Protestant,
not to say the Puritan, spirit, appealed to Elizabethan tastes,
and Crowley had already printed two editions of it, Rogers a third.
But he makes upon it the extraordinary remark, “The first
I have seen that observed the quantity of our verse without the
curiosity of rhyme.” What Webbe here means by
“quantity,” or whether he had any clear deliberate
meaning at all, it is impossible to see: it is needless to say that
Langland is absolutely non-quantitative in the ordinary sense,
that if “quantity” means number of syllables he observes none,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>and that he can be scanned only on the alliterative-accentual
system. For Gascoigne Webbe relies on “E. K.”; brackets
“the divers works of the old Earl of Surrey” with a dozen
others; is copious on Phaer, Golding, &#38;c., and mentions
George Whetstone and Anthony Munday in words which
would be adequate for Sackville (who is not named), and
hardly too low for Spenser; while Gabriel Harvey is deliberately
ranked with Spenser himself. Yet these things, rightly
valued, are not great shame to Webbe. If he borrows from
“E. K.” some scorn of the “ragged rout of rakehell rhymers,”
and adds more of his own, he specifies nobody; and his depreciation
is only the defect which almost necessarily accompanies
the quality of his enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c000'>His piece, though not long, is longer than those of Gascoigne,
Sidney, and King James. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>but enthusiastic,</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> After a dedication (not more
than excusably laudatory) to his patron Sulyard,
there is a curious preface to “The Noble Poets of
England,” who, if they had been inclined to be censorious,
might have replied that Master Webbe, while complimenting
them, went about to show that the objects of his compliment
did not exist. “It is,” he says, “to be wondered of all, and is
lamented of many, that, while all other studies are used
eagerly, only Poetry has found fewest friends to amend it.”
We have “as sharp and quick wits” in England as ever were
Greeks and Romans: our tongue is neither coarse nor harsh,
as she has already shown. All that is wanted is “some perfect
platform or Prosodia of <a id='corr180.27'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='versifying'>versifying”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_180.27'><ins class='correction' title='versifying'>versifying”</ins></a></span>: either in imitation of
Greeks and Latins, or with necessary alterations. So, if the
Noble Poets would “look so low from their divine <a id='corr180.29'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='cogitations'>cogitations”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_180.29'><ins class='correction' title='cogitations'>cogitations”</ins></a></span>,
and “run over the simple censure” of Master Webbe’s “weak
brain,” something might, perhaps, be done.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>if uncritical,</i></div>

<p class='c000'>The treatise itself begins with the usual etymological definition
of poetry, as “making,” and the usual comments on
the word “Vates”; but almost immediately digresses
into praise of our late famous English poet who
wrote the <cite>Shepherd’s Calendar</cite> and a wish to see his “English
Poet” (mentioned by E. K.), which, alas! none of us have
ever seen. This is succeeded, first by the classical and then by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>the English historical sketches, which have been commented
upon. It ends with fresh laudation of Spenser.</p>

<p class='c000'>Webbe then turns to the general consideration of poetry
(especially from the allegoric-didactic point of view), subject,
kinds, &#38;c.; and it is to be observed that, though he several
times cites Aristotle, he leans much more on Horace, and on
Elyot’s translations from him and other Latins. He then
proceeds to a rather unnecessarily elaborate study of the
<cite>Æneid</cite>, with large citations both from the original and from
Phaer’s translation, after which he returns once more to Spenser,
and holds him up as at least the equal of Virgil and Theocritus.
Indeed the <cite>Calendar</cite> is practically his theme all through,
though he diverges from and embroiders upon it. Then, after
glancing amiably enough at Tusser, and mentioning a translation
of his own of the <cite>Georgics</cite>, which has got into the hands
of some piratical publisher, he attacks the great rhyme-question,
to which he has, from the Preface onwards, more than
once alluded. Much of what he says is borrowed, or a little
advanced, from Ascham; but Webbe is less certain about the
matter than his master, and again diverges into a consideration
of divers English metres, always illustrated, where possible,
from the <cite>Calendar</cite>. Still harking back again, he decides that
“the true kind of versifying” might have been effected in
English: though (as Campion, with better wits, did after him)
he questions whether some alteration of the actual Greek and
Latin forms is not required. He gives a list of classical feet
(fairly correct, except that he makes the odd confusion of a
trochee and a tribrach), and discusses the liberties which
must be taken with English to adjust it to some of them.
Elegiacs, he thinks, will not do: Hexameters and Sapphics go
best. And, to prove this, he is rash enough to give versions
of his own, in the former metre, of Virgil’s first and second
eclogues, in the latter of Spenser’s beautiful</p>

      <div class='line'>“Ye dainty nymphs that in this blessed brook.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It is enough to say that he succeeds in stripping all three of
every rag of poetry. A translation of Fabricius’<a id='r253'></a><a href='#f253' class='c019'><sup>[253]</sup></a> prose syllabus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>of Horace’s rules, gathered not merely out of the <span lang="la"><cite>Ep. ad
Pisones</cite></span> but elsewhere, and an “epilogue,” modest as to himself,
sanguine as to what will happen when “the rabble of bald
rhymes is turned to famous works,” concludes the piece.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>in appreciation.</i></div>

<p class='c000'>On the whole, to use the hackneyed old phrase once more,
we could have better spared a better critic than Webbe, who
gives us—in a fashion invaluable to map-makers of
the early exploration of English criticism—the
workings of a mind furnished with no original genius for
poetry, and not much for literature, not very extensively or
accurately erudite, but intensely <em>interested</em> in matters literary,
and especially in matters poetical, generously enthusiastic for
such good things as were presented to it, not without some
mother-wit even in its crazes, and encouraged in those crazes
not, as in Harvey’s case, by vanity, pedantry, and bad taste,
but by its very love of letters. Average dispositions of this
kind were, as a rule, diverted either into active life—very much
for the good of the nation—or—not at all for its good—into
the acrid disputes of hot-gospelling and Puritanism. Webbe,
to the best of his modest powers, was a devotee of literature:
for which let him have due honour.</p>

<p class='c000'>Puttenham—or whosoever else it was, if it was not Puttenham<a id='r254'></a><a href='#f254' class='c019'><sup>[254]</sup></a>—has
some points of advantage, and one great one
of disadvantage, in comparison with Webbe. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Puttenham’s (?)</i> Art of English Poesie.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In
poetical faculty there is very little to choose between
them—the abundant specimens of his own
powers, which the author or <cite>The Art of English
Poesie</cite> gives (and which are eked out by a late copy of one of
the works referred to, <cite>Partheniades</cite>), deserve the gibes they
receive in one of our scanty early notices of the book, that by
Sir John Harington (<i>v. infra</i>). On the other hand, Puttenham
has very little of that engaging enthusiasm which atones for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>so much in his contemporary. But this very want of enthusiasm
somewhat prepares us for, though it need not necessarily
accompany, merits which we do not find in Webbe, considered
as a critic. <cite>The Art of English Poesy</cite>, which, as has been said,
appeared in 1589, three years later than Webbe’s, but which,
from some allusions, may have been written, or at least begun,
before it, and which, from other allusions, must have been the
work of a man well advanced in middle life, is methodically
composed, very capable in range and plan, and supported with
a by no means contemptible erudition, and no inconsiderable
supply of judgment and common-sense. It was unfortunate
for Puttenham that he was just a little too old: that having
been—as from a fairly precise statement of his he must have
been—born <i>cir.</i> 1530-35, he belonged to the early and uncertain
generation of Elizabethan men of letters, the Googes and
Turbervilles, and Gascoignes, not to the generation of Sidney
and Spenser, much less to that of Shakespeare and Jonson.
But what he had he gave: and it is far from valueless.</p>

<p class='c000'>The book is “to-deled” (as the author of the <cite>Ancren Riwle</cite>
would say) into three books—“Of Poets and Poesie,” “Of Proportion,”
and “Of Ornament.” <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Its erudition.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It begins, as usual,
with observations on the words poet and maker,
references to the ancients, &#38;c.; but this exordium, which is
fitly written in a plain but useful and agreeable style, is commendably
short. The writer lays it down, with reasons, that
there may be an Art of English as of Latin and Greek poetry;
but cannot refrain from the same sort of “writing at large” as to
poets being the first philosophers, &#38;c., which we have so often
seen.<a id='r255'></a><a href='#f255' class='c019'><sup>[255]</sup></a> Indeed we must lay our account with the almost
certain fact that all writers of this period had seen Sidney’s
<cite>Defence</cite> at least in MS. or had heard of it. He comes closer to
business with his remarks on the irreption of rhyme into Greek
and Latin poetry; and shows a better knowledge of leonine and
other mediæval Latin verse, not merely than Webbe, but even
than Ascham. A very long section then deals with the
question—all-interesting to a man of the Renaissance—in what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>reputation poets were with princes of old, and how they be
now contemptible (wherein Puttenham shows a rather remarkable
acquaintance with modern European literature), and
then turns to the subject or matter of poesy and the forms
thereof, handling the latter at great length, and with a fair
sprinkle of literary anecdote. At last he comes to <em>English</em>
poetry; and though, as we might expect, he does not go
behind the late fourteenth century, he shows rather more knowledge
than Webbe and (not without slips here and elsewhere)
far more comparative judgment. It must, however, be admitted
that, engaging as is his description of Sir Walter Raleigh’s
“vein most lofty, insolent, and passionate,” he does not show
to advantage in the patronising glance in passing at “that other
gentleman who wrote the late <cite>Shepherd’s Calendar</cite>,” contrasted
with the description of the Queen our Sovereign lady, “whose
Muse easily surmounteth all the rest in any kind on which
it may please her Majesty to employ her pen.” But here the
allowance comes in: the stoutest Tory of later days can never
wholly share, though he may remotely comprehend, the curious
mixture of religious, romantic, patriotic, amatory, and interested
feelings with which the men of the sixteenth century wrote
about Gloriana.</p>

<p class='c000'>The second book deals with Proportion, in which word
Puttenham includes almost everything belonging to Prosody
in its widest sense—staff, stanza, measure, metres,
and feet, “cæsure,” rhyme, accent, cadence, situation
(by which he means the arrangement of the rhymes), and proportion
in figure. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Systematic arrangement</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> On most of these heads he speaks more
or less in accordance with his fellows (though he very noticeably
abstains from extreme commendation or condemnation of
rhyme), save that, for the moment, he seems to neglect the
“new versifying.” It is, however, but for a moment. After
his chapters on “proportion” in figure (the fanciful egg, wheel,
lozenge, &#38;c., which he himself argues for, and which were to
make critics of the Addisonian type half-angry and half-sad),
he deals with the subject.</p>

<p class='c000'>About this “new versifying” he is evidently in two minds.
He had glanced at it before (and refers to the glance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>now)<a id='r256'></a><a href='#f256' class='c019'><sup>[256]</sup></a> as “a nice and scholastic curiosity.” However, “for the
information of our young makers, and pleasure to those who
be delighted in novelty, <em>and to the intent that we may not seem
by ignorance or oversight to omit</em>,”<a id='r257'></a><a href='#f257' class='c019'><sup>[257]</sup></a> he “will now deal with it.”
Which he does at great length; and, at any rate sometimes,
with a clearer perception of the prosodic values than any other,
even Spenser, had yet shown. But he does not seem quite
at home in the matter, and glides off to a discussion of feet—classical
feet—in the usual rhymed English verse.</p>

<p class='c000'>The third book is longer than the first and second put
together, and is evidently that in which the author himself
took most pleasure. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>and exuberant indulgence in Figures.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It is called “Of Ornament,”
but practically deals with the whole question of
<span lang="la"><i>lexis</i></span> or style, so that it is at least common to
Rhetoric and Poetics. In one respect, too, it belongs
more specially to the former, in that it contains the most
elaborate treatment of rhetorical figures to be found, up to its
time, in English literature. Full eighty pages are occupied
with the catalogue of these “Figures Auricular” wherein
Puttenham (sometimes rather badly served by his pen or his
printer) ransacks the Greek rhetoricians, and compiles a list
(with explanations and examples) of over one hundred and
twenty. It is preceded and followed by more general remarks,
of which some account must be given.</p>

<p class='c000'>Beginning with an exordial defence of ornament in general,
Puttenham proceeds to argue that set speeches, as in Parliament,
not merely may but ought to be couched in something
more than a conversational style. This added grace must be
given by (1) Language, (2) Style, (3) Figures. On diction he
has remarks both shrewd and interesting, strongly commending
the language of the Court and of the best citizens, not provincial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>speech, or that of seaports, or of universities, or in other
ways merely technical. “The usual speech of the Court and
that of London and the shires lying about London, within ten
miles and not much above” is his norm. There is also a
noteworthy and very early reference to English dictionaries,
and a cautious section on neologisms introduced from other
tongues to fill wants. Style he will have reached by “a constant
and continual tenor of writing,” and gives the usual
subdivision of high, low, and middle. And so to his Figures.</p>

<p class='c000'>The details and illustrations of the long catalogue of these
invite comment, but we must abstain therefrom. When the
list is finished, Puttenham returns to his generalities with a discussion
of the main principle of ornament, which he calls <em>Decorum</em>
or “Decency,” dividing and illustrating the kinds of it into choice
of subject, diction, delivery, and other things, not without good
craftsmanship, and with a profusion of anecdotes chiefly of the
Helotry kind. He then (rather oddly, but not out of keeping
with his classical models) has a chapter of decorum in behaviour,
turns to the necessity of concealing art, and ends with a highly
flattering conclusion to the Queen.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have yet to mention some minorities; less briefly, the
two champions—Campion and Daniel, who brought the question
of “Rhyme <i>v.</i> 'Verse'” to final arbitrament of battle; the great
name (not so great here as elsewhere) of Francis Bacon; and
lastly, one who, if representative of a further stage, is far the
greatest of Elizabethan critics, and perhaps the only English
critic who deserves the adjective great before Dryden.</p>

<p class='c000'>The earliest (1591) of these is Sir John Harington, in the
prefatory matter<a id='r258'></a><a href='#f258' class='c019'><sup>[258]</sup></a> of his translation of the <cite>Orlando</cite>,
which contains the gibe at Puttenham above referred
to. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Minors: Harington, Meres, Webster, Bolton, &#38;c.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It is otherwise much indebted to Sidney,
from whom, however, Harington differs in allowing
more scope to allegorical interpretation. Then comes Francis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>Meres, whose <cite>Palladis Tamia</cite><a id='r259'></a><a href='#f259' class='c019'><sup>[259]</sup></a> (1598) is to be eternally mentioned
with gratitude, because it gives us our one real document
about the order of Shakespeare’s plays, but is quite childish in
the critical characterisation which it not uninterestingly attempts.
Webster’s equally famous, and universally known,
epitheting of the work of Shakespeare and others in the Preface
to <cite>The White Devil</cite> (1612) adds yet another instance of the
short sight of contemporaries; but tempting as it may be to
comment on these, it would not become a Historian of Criticism
to do so in this context. Sir W. Vaughan in <cite>The Golden Grove</cite>
(1600) had earlier dealt, and Bolton<a id='r260'></a><a href='#f260' class='c019'><sup>[260]</sup></a> in his <cite>Hypercritica</cite> (1616),
and Peacham in his <cite>Complete Gentleman</cite> (1622), were later to
deal, with Poetry, but in terms adding nothing to, and probably
borrowed from, the utterances of Sidney, Webbe, and Puttenham.
Their contributions are “sma’ sums,” as Bailie Nicol
Jarvie says, and we must neglect them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most interesting literary result of the “new versifying”
craze is to be found, without doubt, in the <cite>Observations in the
Art of English Poesy</cite> of Thomas Campion<a id='r261'></a><a href='#f261' class='c019'><sup>[261]</sup></a> and the
subsequent <cite>Defence of Rhyme</cite> of Samuel Daniel. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Campion and his</i> Observations.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The
former was issued in 1602, and the latter still later:—that
is to say more than twenty years after Spenser’s
and Harvey’s letters, and more than thirty after the appearance—let
alone the writing—of Ascham’s <cite>Schoolmaster</cite>.
In the interval the true system of English prosody had put
itself practically beyond all real danger; but the critical craze
had never received its quietus. Nay, it survived to animate
Milton: and there are persons whom we could only name for
the sake of honour, and who do not seem to see that it is dead
even yet. Both the writers mentioned were true poets: and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>the curious thing is that the more exquisitely romantic poet of
the two was the partisan of classical prosody. But Campion—who
dedicated his book to Lord Buckhurst, the <span lang="fr"><i>doyen</i></span> (except
poor old Churchyard) of English poetry at the time, and one
whose few but noble exercises in it need hardly vail their crest
to any contemporary poetry but Spenser’s and Shakespeare’s—was
far too wise a man, as well as far too good a poet, to
champion any longer the break-neck and break-jaw hexameters
of Harvey and Stanyhurst. We have seen that almost from the
first there had been questions of heart among the partisans of
the New Versifying. That English is not tolerant of dactyls—that
the dactyl, do what you will, in English, will tilt itself
into an anapæst with an anacrusis—is a truth which no impartial
student of metre with an ear, and with an eye to cover the
history of English poetry, can deny. Some even of these
pioneers had seen this: Campion has the boldness to declare it
in the words, “It [the dactylic hexameter] is an attempt altogether
against the nature of our language.” But though he was
bold so far, he was not quite bold enough. He could not surmount
the queer Renaissance objection to rhyme. That all the
arguments against the “barbarism” of this tell equally against
Christianity, chivalry, the English constitution, the existence
of America, gunpowder, glass-windows, coal-fires, and a very
large number of other institutions of some usefulness, never
seems to have occurred to any of these good folk. But no man
can escape his time. Campion, not noticing, or not choosing
to notice, the intensely English quality of the anapæst, limits,
or almost limits, our verse to iambs and trochees. It was possible
for him—though it still appears to be difficult for some—to
recognise the tribrach, the mere suggestion of which in English
verse threw Dr Guest into a paroxysm of “!!!!’s,” but
which exists as certainly as does the iamb itself. On the contrary
he shows himself in advance of Guest, and of most behind
Guest to his own time, by admitting tribrachs in the third
and fifth places. Nay, he even sees that a trochee may take
the place of an iamb (Milton’s probably borrowed secret) in
the first place, though his unerring ear (I think there is no
verse of Campion’s that is unmusical) insists on some other foot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>than an iamb following—otherwise, he says, “it would too
much <em>drink up</em> the verse.” But, on the whole, he sets himself
to work, a self-condemned drudge, to make iambic and trochaic
verses without rhyme. And on these two, with certain licences,
he arranges schemes of English elegiacs, anacreontics, and the
rest. Some of the examples of these are charming poems, notably
the famous “<cite>Rose-Cheeked Laura</cite>,” and the beautiful “<cite>Constant to
None</cite>,” while Campion’s subsequent remarks on English quantity
are among the acutest on the subject. But the whole thing has
on it the curse of “flying in the face of nature.” You have
only to take one of Campion’s own poems (written mostly <em>after</em>
the <cite>Observations</cite>) in natural rhyme, and the difference will be
seen at once. It simply comes to this—that the good rhymeless
poems would be infinitely better with rhyme, and that the
bad ones, while they might sometimes be absolutely saved by
the despised invention of Huns and Vandals, are always made
worse by its absence.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the preface of Daniel’s answering <i>Defence of Rhyme to
all the worthy lovers and learned professors</i> [<i>thereof</i>] <i>within
His Majesty’s dominions</i>,<a id='r262'></a><a href='#f262' class='c019'><sup>[262]</sup></a> he says that he wrote
it “about a year since,” upon the “great reproach”
given by Campion, and some give it the date of
1603 or even 1602; but Dr Grosart’s reprint is dated five
years later. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Daniel and his</i> Defence of Rhyme.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The learned gentleman to whom it was specially
written was no less a person than William Herbert, Earl of
Pembroke, whom some of us (acknowledging that the matter is
no matter) do not yet give up as “Mr W. H.” The advocate
affects, with fair rhetorical excuse (though of course he must have
known that the craze was nearly half a century old, and had at
least not been discouraged by his patron’s uncle nearly a generation
before), to regard the attack on rhyming as something new,
as merely concerned with the “measures” of Campion. Daniel,
always a gentleman, deals handsomely with his antagonist,
whom he does not name, but describes as “this detractor whose
commendable rhymes, albeit now an enemy to rhyme, have
given heretofore to the world the best notice of his worth,” and
as a man “of fair parts and good reputation.” And having put
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>himself on the best ground, in this way, from the point of view
of morals and courtesy, he does the same in matter of argument
by refusing to attack Campion’s “numbers” in themselves (“We
could,” he says well, “have allowed of his numbers, had he not
graced his rhymes”), and by seizing the unassailable position
given by custom and nature—“Custom that is before all law;
Nature that is above all art.” In fact, not Jonson himself, and
certainly none else before Jonson, has comprehended, or at least
put, the truth of the matter as Daniel puts it, that arbitrary
laws imposed on the poetry of any nation are absurd—that the
verse of a language is such as best consorts with the nature of
that language. This seems a truism enough perhaps; but it
may be very much doubted whether all critics recognise it, and
its consequences, even at the present day. And it is certain
that we may search other early English critics in vain for a
frank recognition of it. With an equally bold and sure foot he
strides over the silly stuff about “invention of barbarous ages”
and the like. Whatever its origin (and about this he shows a
wise carelessness), it is “an excellence added to this work of
measure and harmony, far happier than any proportion quantity
could ever show.” It “gives to the ear an echo of a delightful
report,” and to the memory “a deeper impression of what is
delivered.” He is less original (as well as, some may think, less
happy) in distinguishing the accent of English from the quantity
of the classical tongues; but the classicisers before Campion, if
not Campion himself, had made such a mess of quantity, and
had played such havoc with accent, that he may well be
excused. The universality of rhyme is urged, and once more
says Daniel (with that happy audacity in the contemning of
vain things which belongs to the born exploders of crazes),
“If the barbarian likes it, it is because it sways the affections of
the barbarian; if civil nations practise it, it works upon their
hearts; if all, then it has a power in nature upon all.” But it
will be said, “Ill customs are to be left.” No doubt: but the
question is begged. Who made <em>this</em> custom “ill”? Rhyme
aims at pleasing—and it pleases. Suffer then the world to enjoy
that which it knows and what it likes, for all the tyrannical
rules of rhetoric cannot make it otherwise. Why are we to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>a mere <span lang="la"><i>servum pecus</i></span>, only to imitate the Greeks and Latins?
Their way was natural to them: let ours be so to us. “Why
should laboursome curiosity still lay affliction on our best
delights?” Moreover, to a spirit whom nature hath “fitted
for that mystery,” rhyme is no impediment, “but rather giveth
wings to mount.” The necessary historical survey follows, with
a surprising and very welcome justification of the Middle Ages
against both Classics and Renaissance. “Let us,” says this true
Daniel come to judgment, “go not further, but look upon the
wonderful architecture of the State of England, and see whether
they were unlearned times that could give it such a form?”
And if politically, why not poetically? Some acute and, in the
other sense, rather sharp criticism of Campion’s details follows,
with a few apologetic remarks for mixture of masculine and
feminine rhymes on his own part: and the whole concludes in
an admirable peroration with a great end-note to it. Not easily
shall we find, either in Elizabethan times or in any other, a
happier combination of solid good sense with eager poetic sentiment,
of sound scholarship with wide-glancing intelligence, than
in this little tractate of some thirty or forty ordinary pages,
which dispelled the delusions of two generations, and made the
poetical fortune of England sure.</p>

<p class='c000'>The contributions of “large-browed Verulam” to criticism
have sometimes been spoken of with reverence: and it is not uncommon
to find, amid the scanty classics of the subject,
which until recently have been recommended to the
notice of inquirers, not merely a place, but a place of very high
honour, assigned to <cite>The Advancement of Learning</cite>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Bacon.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Actual,
unprejudiced, and to some extent expert, reference to the works,
however, will not find very much to justify this estimate: and,
indeed, a little thought, assisted by very moderate knowledge,
would suffice to make it rather surprising that Bacon should give
us so much, than disappointing that he should give us little or
nothing. A producer of literature who at his best has few
superiors, and a user of it for purposes of quotation, who would
deserve the name of genius for this use alone if he had no other
title thereto—Bacon was yet by no means inclined by his main
interests and objects, or by his temperament, either towards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>great exaltation of letters, or towards accurate and painstaking
examination of them. Indeed, it is in him—almost first of all
men, certainly first of all great modern men—that we find that
partisan opposition between literature and science which has
constantly developed since. It is true that his favourite
method of examination into “forms” might seem tempting as
applied to literature; and that it would, incidentally if not
directly, have yielded more solid results than his Will-o'-the-wisp
chase of the Form of Heat. But this very craze of his
may suggest that if he had undertaken literary criticism it
would have been on the old road of Kinds and Figures and
Qualities, in which we could expect little but glowing
rhetorical generalisation from him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor is the nature of such small critical matter as we actually
have from him very different. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Essays.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The Essays practically give us
nothing but the contents of that <cite>Of Studies</cite>, a piece
too well known to need quotation; too much in the
early pregnant style of the author to bear compression or
analysis; and too general to repay it. For the critic and
the man of letters generally it is, in its own phrase, to be not
merely tasted, nor even swallowed, but chewed and digested;
yet its teachings have nothing more to do with the critical
function of “study” than with all others.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <cite>Advancement</cite><a id='r263'></a><a href='#f263' class='c019'><sup>[263]</sup></a> at least excuses the greatness thrust upon
it in the estimates above referred to, not merely by the
apparent necessity that the author should deal with
Criticism, but by a certain appearance of his
actually doing so. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Advancement of Learning.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Comparatively early in the
First Book he tackles the attention to style which sprang up
at the Renaissance, opening his discussion by the ingenious but
slightly unhistorical attribution of it to Martin Luther, who
was forced to awake all antiquity, and call former times to his
succour, against the Bishop of Rome. Not a few names, for the
best part of two centuries before the great cause of <i>Martinus</i> v.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span><i>Papam</i> was launched, from Petrarch and Boccaccio to Erasmus
and Reuchlin, will put in evidence before the tribunal of
chronology against this singular assertion; and though the
Italian Humanists of the fifteenth century might not (at least
in thought) care anything for the Pope except as a source of
donatives and benefices, it is certain that most of them were
as constitutionally disinclined to abet Luther as they were
chronologically disabled from in any way abetting him.
Bacon’s argument and further survey are, however, better than
this beginning. To understand the ancients (he says justly
enough) it was necessary to make a careful study of their
language. Further, the opposition of thought to the Schoolmen
naturally brought about a recoil from the barbarisms of
Scholastic style, and the anxiety to win over the general
imprinted care and elegance and vigour on preaching and
writing. All this, he adds as justly, turned to excess. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Its denunciation of mere word-study.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Men
began to “hunt more after words than matter;
more after the choiceness of the phrase and the
round and clean composition of the sentence, and
the sweet falling of the clauses, and the varying and illustration
of their words with tropes and figures, than after the
weight of matter, worth of subject, soundness of argument,
life of invention, or depth of judgment.” The Ciceronianism of
Osorius, Sturm, “Car of Cambridge,” and even Ascham, receives
more or less condemnation; and Erasmus is, of course, cited
for gibes at it. On this text Bacon proceeds to enlarge in his
own stately rhetoric, coolly admitting that it “is a thing not
hastily to be condemned, to clothe and adorn the obscurity
even of philosophy itself with sensible and plausible elocution.”
But he very quickly glides off into his usual denunciations of
the schoolmen. Nor have I found anything else in this First
Book really germane to our purpose; for one cannot cite
as such the desultory observations on patronage of literature
(among other branches of learning) which fill a good part of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Second Book is somewhat more fruitful in quantity, if not
very much; but the quality remains not very different. The
opening “Address to the King” contains, in an interesting first
draft (as we may call it), the everlasting grumble of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>scientific man, that science is not sufficiently endowed, the
further grumble at mere book-learning, the cry for the promotion—by
putting money in its purse—of research. The
Second and Third Chapters contain some plans of books drawn
up in Bacon’s warm imaginative way, especially a great series of
Histories, with the <cite>History of England</cite> for their centre. And
then we come, in the Fourth Chapter, to Poesy.</p>

<p class='c000'>But except for Bacon’s majestic style (which, however, by
accident or intention, is rather below itself here) there is
absolutely nothing novel. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Its view of Poetry.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The view (which, as we
have seen, all the Elizabethan critics adopted, probably
from the Italians)—the view is that poetry is just a part of
learning licensed in imagination; a fanciful history intended to
give satisfaction to the mind of man in things where history is
not; something particularly prevalent and useful in barbarous
ages; divisible into narrative, representative and allusive;
useful now and then, but (as Aristotle would say) not a thing
to take very seriously. Yet poetry, a <span lang="la"><i>vinum dæmonum</i></span> at the
worst, a mere illusion anyhow, is still, even as such, a refuge
from, and remedy for, sorrow and toil. Of its form, as distinguished
from its matter, he says,<a id='r264'></a><a href='#f264' class='c019'><sup>[264]</sup></a> “Poetry is but a character
of style, and belongeth to arts of speech, and is not pertinent
for the present.” He attempts no defence of it as of other
parts of learning, because “being as a plant that cometh of the
lust of the earth without a formal seed, it hath sprung up and
spread abroad more than any other kind.” And he turns from
it to philosophy, with the more than half-disdainful adieu, “It
is not good to stay too long in the theatre.”</p>

<p class='c000'>We might almost quit him here with a somewhat similar
leave-taking; but for his great reputation some other places
shall be handled. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Some</i> <span lang="la">obiter dicta.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> At XIV. 11 there are some
remarks on the delusive powers of words; at XVI.
4, 5 some on grammar and rhetoric, including a rather interesting
observation, not sufficiently expanded or worked out, that
“in modern languages it seemeth to me as free to make new
measures of verses as of dances”; in XVIII. a handling of
strictly oratorical rhetoric, with a digression to these “Colours
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>of Good and Evil” which interested Bacon so much; in XX.
another descant on the same art; in XXI. a puff of the
<cite>Basilikon Doron</cite>; in XXXII. observations on the moral
influence of books; in XXXV. some general observations on
literature; and, just before the close, a well-known and often-quoted
eulogy, certainly not undeserved, of the eloquence of the
English pulpit for forty years past.</p>

<p class='c000'>If it were not for the singular want of a clear conception
of literary Criticism, which has prevailed so long and so widely,
it would hardly be necessary to take, with any
seriousness at all, a man who has no more than this
to say on the subject.<a id='r265'></a><a href='#f265' class='c019'><sup>[265]</sup></a> <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The whole of very slight importance.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It is most assuredly no
slight to Bacon to deny him a place in a regiment where he
never had the least ambition to serve. That he was himself
a great practitioner of literature, and so, necessarily if indirectly,
a critic of it in his own case, is perfectly true; the
remarks which have been quoted above on the Ciceronians
show that, when he took the trouble, and found the opportunity,
he could make them justly and soundly. But his
purpose, his interests, his province, his vein, lay far elsewhere.
To him, it is pretty clear, literary expression was, in relation
to his favourite studies and dreams, but a higher kind of pen-and-ink
or printing-press. He distrusted the stability of
modern languages, and feared that studies couched in them
might some day or other come to be unintelligible and lost to
the world. This famous fear explains the nature and the
limits of his interest in literature. It was a vehicle or a
treasury, a distributing agent or a guard. Its functions and
qualities accorded: it was to be clear, not disagreeable, solidly
constructed, intelligible to as large a number of readers as
possible. The psychological character and morphological definition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>of poetry interested him philosophically. But in the
art and the beauty of poetry and literature generally, for their
own sakes, he seems to have taken no more interest than he
did in the coloured pattern plots in gardens, which he compared
to “tarts.” To a man so minded, as to those more
ancient ones of similar mind whom we have discussed in the
first volume, Criticism proper could, at the best, be a pastime
to be half ashamed of—a “theatre” in which to while away the
hours; it could not possibly be a matter of serious as well as
enthusiastic study.</p>

<p class='c000'>Between Bacon and Ben may be best noticed the short
<cite>Anacrisis or Censure of Poets, Ancient and Modern</cite>,<a id='r266'></a><a href='#f266' class='c019'><sup>[266]</sup></a> by Sir
William Alexander, Earl of Stirling. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Stirling’s</i> Anacrisis.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It has received
high praise;<a id='r267'></a><a href='#f267' class='c019'><sup>[267]</sup></a> but even those who think by
no means ill of <cite>Aurora</cite>, may find some difficulty in indorsing
this. It is simply a sort of “Note,” written, as the author
says, to record his impressions during a reading of the poets,
which he had undertaken as refreshment after great travail
both of body and mind. He thinks Language “but the apparel
of poesy,” thereby going even further than those who would
assign that position to verse, and suggesting a system of
“Inarticulate Poetics,” which he would have been rather put
to it to body forth. He only means, however, that he judges
in the orthodox Aristotelian way, by “the fable and contexture.”
A subsequent comparison of a poem to a garden suggests
Vauquelin de la Fresnaye (<i>v. supra</i>, p. 129), whom he may
have read. Alexander is a sort of general lover in poetry; he
likes this in Virgil, that in Ovid, that other in Horace; defends
Lucan against Scaliger, even to the point of blaming the conclusion
of the <cite>Æneid</cite>; finds “no man that doth satisfy him
more than that notable Italian, Torquato Tasso”; admits the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>historical as well as the fictitious poetic subject; but thinks
that “the treasures of poetry cannot be better bestowed than
upon the apparelling of Truth; and Truth cannot be better
apparelled to please young lovers than with the excellences
of poetry.” Disrespectful language neither need nor should
be used of so slight a thing, which is, and pretends to be,
nothing more than a sort of table-book entry by a gentleman
of learning as well as quality. But, if it has any “importance”
at all, it is surely that of being yet another proof of the rapid
diffusion of critical taste and practice, not of stating “theory
and methods considerably in advance of the age.” If we could
take extensively his protest against those who “would bound
the boundless liberty of the poet,” such language might indeed
be justified; but the context strictly limits it to the very
minor, though then, and for long before and after, commonly
debated, question of Fiction <i>v.</i> History in subject.</p>

<p class='c000'>Save perhaps in one single respect (where the defect was not
wholly his fault), Ben Jonson might be described as a critic
armed at all points. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Ben Jonson: his equipment.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> His knowledge of literature
was extremely wide, being at the same time solid
and thorough. While he had an understanding
above all things strong and masculine, he was particularly
addicted, though in no dilettante fashion, to points of form.
His whole energies, and they were little short of Titanic, were
given to literature. And, lastly, if he had not the supremest
poetic genius, he had such a talent that only the neighbourhood
of supremacy dwarfs it. Where he came short was not
in a certain hardness of temper and scholasticism of attitude:
for these, if kept within bounds, and tempered by that enthusiasm
for letters which he possessed, are not bad equipments
for the critic. It was rather in the fact that he still came too
early for it to be possible for him, except by the help of a
miracle, to understand the achievements and value of the
vernaculars. By his latest days, indeed,<a id='r268'></a><a href='#f268' class='c019'><sup>[268]</sup></a> the positive performance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>of these was already very great. Spain has hardly
added anything since, and Italy not very much, to her share
of European literature; France was already in the first flush
of her “classical” period, after a long and glorious earlier
history: and what Ben’s own contemporaries in England had
done, all men know. But mediæval literature was shut from
him, as from all, till far later; he does not seem to have been
much drawn to Continental letters, and, perhaps in their case,
as certainly in English, he was too near—too much a part of
the movement—to get it into firm perspective.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a sense the critical temper in Jonson is all-pervading. It
breaks out side by side with, and sometimes even within, his
sweetest lyrics; it interposes what may be called
<span lang="la"><i>parabases</i></span> in the most unexpected passages<a id='r269'></a><a href='#f269' class='c019'><sup>[269]</sup></a> of his
plays. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His</i> Prefaces, <i>&#38;c.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> <cite>The Poetaster</cite> is almost as much criticism
dramatised as <cite>The Frogs</cite>. But there are three “places,” or
groups of places, which it inspires, not in mere suggestion, but
with propriety—the occasional Prefaces, or observations, to and
on the plays themselves, the <cite>Conversations with Drummond</cite>, and,
above all, the at last fairly (though not yet sufficiently) known
<cite>Discoveries</cite> or <cite>Timber</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>To piece together, with any elaboration, the more scattered
critical passages would be fitter for a monograph on Jonson
than for a History of Criticism. The “Address to the Readers”
of <cite>Sejanus</cite>, which contains a reference to the author’s lost <cite>Observations
on Horace, his Art of Poetry</cite> (not the least of such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>losses) is a fair specimen of them: the dedication of <cite>Volpone</cite>
to “the most noble and most equal sisters, Oxford and Cambridge,”
a better. In both, and in numerous other passages of
prose and verse, we find the real and solid, though somewhat
partial, knowledge, the strong sense, the methodic scholarship
of Ben, side by side with his stately, not Euphuistic, but
rather too close-packed style, his not ill-founded, but slightly
excessive, self-confidence, and that rough knock-down manner
of assertion and characterisation which reappeared in its most
unguarded form in the <cite>Conversations</cite> with Drummond.</p>

<p class='c000'>The critical utterances of these <cite>Conversations</cite> are far too
interesting to be passed over here, though we cannot discuss
them in full. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Drummond Conversations.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> They tell us that Ben thought all
(other) rhymes inferior to couplets, and had written
a treatise (which, again, would we had!) both against
Campion and Daniel (see <span lang="fr"><i>ante</i></span>). His objection to “stanzas and
cross rhymes” was that “as the purpose might lead beyond
them, they were all forced.” Sidney “made every one speak as
well as himself,” and so did not keep “decorum” (cf. Puttenham
above). Spenser’s stanzas and matter did not please him. Daniel
was no poet. He did not like Drayton’s “long verses,” nor Sylvester’s
and Fairfax’s translations. He thought the translations
of Homer (Chapman’s) and Virgil (Phaer’s) into “long Alexandrines”
(<i>i.e.</i>, fourteeners) were but prose: yet elsewhere we hear
that he “had some of Chapman by heart.” Harington’s <cite>Ariosto</cite>
was the worst of all translations. Donne was sometimes
“profane,” and “for not keeping of accent deserved hanging”;
but elsewhere he was “the first poet of the world in some
things,” though, “through not being understood, he would
perish.”<a id='r270'></a><a href='#f270' class='c019'><sup>[270]</sup></a> Shakespeare “wanted art”: and “Abram Francis
(Abraham Fraunce) in his English Hexameters was a fool.”
“Bartas was not a poet, but a verser, because he wrote not
fiction.” He cursed Petrarch for redacting verses to sonnets,
“which were like Procrustes’ bed.” Guarini incurred the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>same blame as Sir Philip: and Lucan was good in parts only.
“The best pieces of Ronsard were his Odes.” Drummond’s
own verses “were all good, but smelled too much of the
schools.” The “silver” Latins, as we should expect, pleased
him best. “To have written Southwell’s ‘Burning Babe,’ he
would have been content to destroy many of his.”</p>

<p class='c000'>These are the chief really critical items, though there are
others (putting personal gossip aside) of interest; but it may be
added, as a curiosity, that he told Drummond that he himself
“writ all first in prose” at Camden’s suggestion, and held that
“verses stood all by sense, without colours or accent” (poetic
diction or metre), “which yet at other times he denied,” says
the reporter, a sentence ever to be remembered in connection
with these jottings. Remembering it, there is nothing shocking
in any of these observations, nor anything really inconsistent.
A true critic never holds the neat, positive, “reduced-to-its-lowest-terms”
estimate of authors, in which a criticaster delights.
His view is always facetted, conditioned. But he may,
in a friendly chat, or a conversation for victory, exaggerate this
facet or condition, while altogether suppressing others; and
this clearly is what Ben did.</p>

<p class='c000'>For gloss on the <cite>Conversations</cite>, for reduction to something
like system of the critical remarks scattered through the works,
and for the nearest approach we can have to a formal presentment
of Ben’s critical views, we must go to the <cite>Discoveries</cite>.<a id='r271'></a><a href='#f271' class='c019'><sup>[271]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004'>The fact that we find no less than four titles for the book—<cite>Timber</cite>,
<cite>Explorata</cite>, <cite>Discoveries</cite>, and <cite>Sylva</cite>—with others of its
peculiarities, is explained by the second fact that
Jonson never published it. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Discoveries.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It never appeared in
print till the folio of 1641, years after its author’s death. The
<cite>Discoveries</cite> are described as being made “upon men and matter
as they have flowed out of his daily reading, or had their reflux
to his peculiar notions of the times.” They are, in fact, notes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>unnumbered and unclassified (though batches of more or fewer
sometimes run on the same subject), each with its Latin heading,
and varying in length from a few lines to that of his friend
(and partly master) Bacon’s shorter <cite>Essays</cite>. The influence of
those “silver” Latins whom he loved so much is prominent:
large passages are simply translated from Quintilian, and for
some time<a id='r272'></a><a href='#f272' class='c019'><sup>[272]</sup></a> the tenor is ethical rather than literary. A note on
<span lang="la"><i>Perspicuitas—elegantia</i></span> (p. 7) breaks these, but has nothing
noteworthy about it, and <span lang="la"><i>Bellum scribentium</i></span> (p. 10) is only a
satiric exclamation on the folly of “writers committed together
by the ears for ceremonies, syllables, points,” &#38;c. The longer
<span lang="la"><i>Nil gratius protervo libro</i></span> (pp. 11, 12) seems a retort for some personal
injury, combined with the old complaint of the decadence
and degradation of poetry.<a id='r273'></a><a href='#f273' class='c019'><sup>[273]</sup></a> There is just but rather general
stricture in <span lang="la"><cite>Eloquentia</cite></span> (p. 16) on the difference between the
arguments of the study and of the world. “I would no more
choose a rhetorician for reigning in a school,” says Ben, “than I
would choose a pilot for rowing in a pond.”<a id='r274'></a><a href='#f274' class='c019'><sup>[274]</sup></a> <span lang="la"><cite>Memoria</cite></span> (p. 18)
includes a gird at Euphuism. At last we come to business.
<span lang="la"><i>Censura de poetis</i></span> (p. 21), introduced by a fresh fling at
Euphuism, in <span lang="la"><i>De vere argutis</i></span>, opens with a tolerably confident
note, “Nothing in our age is more preposterous than the
running judgments upon poetry and poets,” with much more to
the same effect, the whole being pointed by the fling, “If it
were a question of the water-rhymer’s<a id='r275'></a><a href='#f275' class='c019'><sup>[275]</sup></a> works against Spenser’s,
I doubt not but they would find more suffrages.” The
famous passage on Shakespeare follows: and the development
of Ben’s view, “would he had blotted a thousand,” leads to a
more general disquisition on the differences of wits, which includes
the sentence already referred to. “Such [<i>i.e.</i>, haphazard
and inconsistent] are all the Essayists, even their master Montaigne.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>The notes now keep close to literature throughout in
substance, though their titles (<i>e.g.</i>, <span lang="la"><cite>Ignorantia animæ</cite></span>), and so
forth, may seem wider. A heading, <span lang="la"><cite>De Claris Oratoribus</cite></span> (p.
26), leads to yet another of the purple passages of the book—that
on Bacon, in which is intercalated a curious <span lang="la"><cite>Scriptorum
catalogus</cite></span>, limited, for the most part, though Surrey and Wyatt
are mentioned, to prose writers. And then for some time ethics,
politics, and other subjects, again have Ben’s chief attention.<a id='r276'></a><a href='#f276' class='c019'><sup>[276]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>We return to literature, after some interval (but with a
parenthetic glance at the <span lang="la"><i>poesis et pictura</i></span> notion at p. 49),
on p. 52, in a curious unheaded letter to an unnamed
Lordship on Education, much of which is translated directly
from Ben Jonson’s favourite Quintilian; and then directly
accost it again with a tractatule <span lang="la"><cite>De stilo et optimo scribendi
genere</cite></span>, p. 54, hardly parting company thereafter. Ben’s prescription
is threefold: read the best authors, observe the best
speakers, and exercise your own style much. But he is well
aware that no “precepts will profit a fool,” and he adapts old
advice to English ingeniously, in bidding men read, not only
Livy before Sallust, but also Sidney before Donne, and to
beware of Chaucer or Gower at first. Here occurs the well-known
<span lang="la"><i>dictum</i></span>, that Spenser “in affecting the ancients writ no
language; yet I would have him read for his matter.” A fine
general head opens with the excellent version of Quintilian,
“We should not protect our sloth with the patronage of
Difficulty,” and this is followed by some shrewd remarks on
diction—the shrewdest being that, after all, the best custom
makes, and ever will continue to make, the best speech—with a
sharp stroke at Lucretius for “scabrousness,” and at Chaucerisms.
Brevity of style, Tacitean and other, is cautiously commended.
In the phrase (<span lang="la"><i>Oratio imago animi</i></span>), p. 64, “language
most shows a man,” Ben seems to anticipate Buffon, as he
later does Wordsworth and Coleridge, by insisting that style is
not merely the dress, but the body of thought.<a id='r277'></a><a href='#f277' class='c019'><sup>[277]</sup></a> All this discussion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>which enters into considerable detail, is of the first
importance, and it occupies nearly a quarter of the whole book.
It is continued, the continuation reaching till the end, by a
separate discussion of poetry.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is interesting, but less so than what comes before. A
somewhat acid, though personally guarded, description of the
present state of the Art introduces the stock definition of
“making,” and its corollary that a poet is not one who writes
in measure, but one who feigns—all as we have found it
before, but (as we should expect of Ben) in succincter and more
scholarly form. Yet the first requisite of the poet is <span lang="la"><i>ingenium</i></span>—goodness
of natural wit; the next exercise of his parts—“bringing
all to the forge and file” (<span lang="fr"><i>sculpte, lime, cisèle!</i></span>); the
third Imitation—to which Ben gives a turn (not exactly new,
for we have met it from Vida downwards), which is not an
improvement, by keeping its modern meaning, and understanding
by it the following of the classics. “But that which we especially
require in him is an exactness of study and multiplicity
of reading.” Yet his liberty is not to be so narrowly circumscribed
as some would have it. This leads to some interesting
remarks on the ancient critics, which the author had evidently
meant to extend: as it is, they break off short.<a id='r278'></a><a href='#f278' class='c019'><sup>[278]</sup></a> We turn to the
Parts of comedy and tragedy, where Ben is strictly regular—the
fable is the imitation of one entire and perfect action, &#38;c. But
this also breaks off, after a discussion of fable itself and episode,
with an evidently quite disconnected fling at “hobbling poems
which run like a brewer’s cart on the stones.”</p>

<p class='c000'>These <cite>Discoveries</cite> have to be considered with a little general
care before we examine them more particularly. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Form of the book.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> They were, it
has been said, never issued by the author himself,
and we do not know whether he ever would
have issued them in their present form. On the one hand, they
are very carefully written, and not mere jottings. In form
(though more modern in style) they resemble the earlier essays
of that Bacon whom they so magnificently celebrate, in their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>deliberate conciseness and pregnancy. On the other hand, it is
almost impossible to doubt that some at least were intended for
expansion; it is difficult not to think that there was plenty
more stuff of the same kind in the solidly constructed and well-stored
treasuries of Ben’s intelligence and erudition. It is most
difficult of all not to see that, in some cases, the thoughts are co-ordinated
into regular tractates, in others left loose, as if for
future treatment of the same kind.</p>

<p class='c000'>Secondly, we should like to know rather more than we do of
the <em>time</em> of their composition. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Its date.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Some of them—such as the
retrospect of Bacon, and to a less degree that of
Shakespeare—<em>must</em> be late; there is a strong probability
that all date from the period between the fire in Ben’s
study, which destroyed so much, and his death—say between
1620 and 1637. But at the same time there is nothing to
prevent his having remembered and recopied observations of
earlier date.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thirdly, it is most important that we rightly understand the
composition of the book. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Mosaic of old and new.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It has sometimes been discovered<a id='r279'></a><a href='#f279' class='c019'><sup>[279]</sup></a> in
these <cite>Discoveries</cite>, with pride, or surprise, or even
scorn, that Ben borrowed in them very largely from
the ancients. Of course he did, as well as something, though
less, from the Italian critics of the age immediately before his
own.<a id='r280'></a><a href='#f280' class='c019'><sup>[280]</sup></a> But in neither case could he have hoped for a moment—and
in neither is there the slightest reason to suppose that he
would have wished if he could have hoped—to disguise his
borrowings from a learned age. When a man—such as, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>instance, Sterne—wishes to steal and escape, he goes to what
nobody reads, not to what everybody is reading. And the
Latins of the Silver Age, the two Senecas, Petronius, Quintilian,
Pliny, were specially favourites with the Jacobean time. In
what is going to be said no difference will be made between
Ben’s borrowings and his original remarks: nor will the fact of
the borrowing be referred to unless there is some special critical
reason. Even the literal translations, which are not uncommon,
are made his own by the nervous idiosyncrasy of the phrase,
and its thorough adjustment to the context and to his own
vigorous and massive temperament.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of real “book-criticism” there are four chief passages, the
brief flings at Montaigne and at “<cite>Tamerlanes</cite> and <cite>Tamerchams</cite>,”
and the longer notices of Shakespeare and Bacon.</p>

<p class='c000'>The flirt at “all the Essayists, even their master Montaigne,”
is especially interesting, because of the high opinion which
Jonson elsewhere expresses of Bacon, the chief, if
not the first, English Essayist of his time, and
because of the fact that not a few of these very <cite>Discoveries</cite> are
“Essays,” if any things ever were. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The fling at Montaigne;</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Nor would it be very easy
to make out a clear distinction, in anything but name, between
some of Ben’s most favourite ancient writers and these despised
persons. It is, however, somewhat easier to understand the
reason of the condemnation. Jonson’s classically ordered mind
probably disliked the ostentatious desultoriness and incompleteness
of the Essay, the refusal, as it were out of mere insolence,
to undertake an orderly treatise. Nor is it quite impossible
that he failed fully to understand Montaigne, and was to some
extent the dupe of that great writer’s fanfaronade of promiscuousness.</p>

<p class='c000'>The “<cite>Tamerlane</cite> and <cite>Tamercham</cite>”<a id='r281'></a><a href='#f281' class='c019'><sup>[281]</sup></a> fling is not even at
first sight surprising. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>at</i> Tamerlane,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It was quite certain that Ben would
seriously despise what Shakespeare only laughed at—the confusion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>the bombast, the want of order and scheme in the
“University Wits”—and it is not probable that he
was well enough acquainted with the even now
obscure development of the earliest Elizabethan drama to
appreciate the enormous improvement which they wrought.
Nay, the nearer approach even of such a dull thing as
<cite>Gorboduc</cite> to “the height of Seneca his style,” might have a
little bribed him as it bribed Sidney. He is true to his side—to
his division of the critical creed—in this also.</p>

<p class='c000'>The train of thought—censure of the vulgar preference—runs
clear from this to the best known passage of the whole,
the section <span lang="la"><cite>De Shakespeare Nostrat</cite></span>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>the Shakespeare Passage,</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It cannot be
necessary to quote it, or to point out that Ben’s
eulogy, splendid as it is, acquires tenfold force from
the fact that it is avowedly given by a man whose general literary
theory is different from that of the subject, while the censure
accompanying it loses force in exactly the same proportion.
What Ben here blames, any ancient critic (perhaps even
Longinus) would have blamed too: what Ben praises, it is not
certain that any ancient critic, except Longinus, would have
seen. Nor is the captious censure of “Cæsar did never wrong
but with just cause” the least interesting part of the whole.
The paradox is not in our present texts: and there have, of
course, not been wanting commentators to accuse Jonson of
garbling or of forgetfulness. This is quite commentatorially
gratuitous and puerile. It is very like Shakespeare to have
written what Ben says: very like Ben to object to the paradox
(which, <span lang="la"><i>pace tanti viri</i></span>, is not “ridiculous” at all, but a deliberate
and effective hyperbole); very like the players to have
changed the text; and most of all like the commentators to
make a fuss about the matter.</p>

<p class='c000'>What may seem the more unstinted eulogy of Bacon is not
less interesting. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>and that on Bacon</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> For here it is obvious that Ben is speaking
with fullest sympathy, and with all but a full acknowledgment
of having met an ideal. Except the
slight stroke, “when he could spare or pass by a jest,” and the
gentle insinuation that <em>Strength</em>, the gift of God, was what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>Bacon’s friends had to implore for him, there is no admixture
whatever in the eulogy of “him who hath filled up all
numbers,<a id='r282'></a><a href='#f282' class='c019'><sup>[282]</sup></a> and performed that in our tongue which may be
compared or preferred to insolent Greece or haughty Rome.”
Indeed it could not have been—even if Ben Jonson had not
been a friend, and, in a way, follower of Bacon—but that he
should regard the Chancellor as his chief of literary men.
Bacon, unluckily for himself, lacked the “unwedgeable and
gnarled” strength of the dramatist, and also was without his
poetic fire, just as Ben could never have soared to the vast, if
vague, conceptions of Bacon’s materialist-Idealism. But they
were both soaked in “literature,” as then understood; they
were the two greatest masters of the closely packed style that
says twenty things in ten words: and yet both could, on
occasion, be almost as rhetorically imaginative as Donne or
Greville. It is doubtful whether Bacon’s own scientific scorn
for words without matter surpassed Jonson’s more literary
contempt of the same phenomenon. Everywhere, or almost
everywhere, there was between them the <span lang="la"><i>idem velle et idem
nolle</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>A limited précis, however, and a few remarks on special
points, cannot do the <cite>Discoveries</cite> justice. The fragmentary
character of the notes that compose it, the pregnant and
deliberately “astringed” style in which these notes are written,
so that they are themselves the bones, as it were, of a much
larger treatise, defy such treatment. Yet it is full of value, as
it gives us more than glimpses</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>or but piecemeal shown. We shall return, in the next chapter,
to his relative position; but something should be said here of
his intrinsic character.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>He does not, as must have been clearly seen, escape the
“classical” limitation. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>General character of the book.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> With some ignorance, doubtless, and
doubtless also some contempt, of the actual achievements
of prose romance, and with that stubborn
distrust of the modern tongues for miscellaneous
prose purposes, which lasted till far into the seventeenth
century, if it did not actually survive into the eighteenth, he
still clings to the old mistakes about the identity of poetry and
“fiction,” about the supremacy of oratory in prose. We hear
nothing about the “new versifying,” though no doubt this
would have been fully treated in his handling of Campion and
Daniel: but had he had any approval for it, that approval
must have been glanced at. His preference for the (stopped)
couplet<a id='r283'></a><a href='#f283' class='c019'><sup>[283]</sup></a> foreshadowed that which, with beneficial effects in
some ways, if by no means in all, was to influence the whole
of English poetry, with the rarest exceptions, for nearly two
centuries. The personal arrogance which, as in Wordsworth’s
case, affected all Ben’s judgment of contemporaries, and which
is almost too fully reflected in the Drummond Conversations,
would probably have made even his more deliberate judgments
of these—his judgments “for publication”—inadequate. But
it is fair to remember that Ben’s theory (if not entirely his
practice, especially in his exquisite lyrics and almost equally
exquisite masques) constrained him to be severe to those contemporaries,
from Spenser, Shakespeare, and Donne downwards.
The mission of the generation may be summed up in
the three words, Liberty, Variety, Romance. Jonson’s tastes
were for Order, Uniformity, Classicism.</p>

<p class='c000'>He is thus doubly interesting—interesting as putting both
with sounder scholarship and more original wit what men from
Ascham to Puttenham, and later, had been trying to say before
him, in the sense of adapting classical precepts to English: and
far more interesting as adumbrating, beforehand, the creed of
Dryden, and Pope, and Samuel Johnson. Many of his individual
judgments are as shrewd as they are one-sided; they
are always well, and sometimes admirably, expressed, in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>style which unites something of Elizabethan colour, and much
of Jacobean weight, with not a little of Augustan simplicity
and proportion. He does not head the line of English critics;
but he heads, and worthily, that of English critics who have
been great both in criticism and in creation.<a id='r284'></a><a href='#f284' class='c019'><sup>[284]</sup></a></p>

the true “Père Duchêne” style which

the Goths in rhyming instead of the
Greeks in versifying” is “to eat acorns
with swine, when we may eat wheat
bread among men.” Rhymers are “a

heads,” “wandering blindly in their

<p class='c000'><a href='#r243'>243</a>. Our two chief English-writing
authorities, Mr Symonds and Mr Spingarn,
are at odds as to Sidney’s indebtedness
to the Italians. He quotes them
but sparingly—Petrarch, Boccaccio,
Landino, among the older writers, Fracastoro
and Scaliger alone, I think, of
the moderns—and Mr Symonds thought
that he owed them little or nothing.
Mr Spingarn, on the other hand, represents
him as following them all in
general, and Minturno in particular.
As usual, it is a case of the gold and
silver shield. My own reading of the
Italian writers of 1530-80 leaves me in
no doubt that Sidney knew them, or
some of them, pretty well. But his
<em>attitude</em> is very different from theirs
as a whole, and already significant of
some specially English characteristics
in criticism.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r278'>278</a>. This is one of the most lacrimable
of the gaps. Ben must have known
other authorities besides Quintilian
well: he even quotes, though only in
part, the great passage of Simylus

<div class='footnote' id='f279'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r279'>279</a>. I am most anxious not to be
thought to reflect on Professor Schelling
in this remark. Dr Schelling’s
indagations of Ben’s debts are most
interesting, and always made in the
right spirit, while, like a good farmer
and sportsman, he has left plenty for
those who come after him to glean and
bag. For instance, the very curious
passage, taken verbatim from the elder
Seneca, about the Platonic Apology
(cf. vol. i. p. 237).</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f280'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r280'>280</a>. Yet in re-reading Jonson, just after
a pretty elaborate overhauling of the
Italians, I find very little certain indebtedness
of detail.  Mr Spingarn
seems to me to go too far in tracing,
p. 88, “small Latin and less Greek”
to Minturno’s “small Latin and <em>very</em>
small Greek,” and the distinction of
<span lang="la"><i>poeta</i></span>, <span lang="la"><i>poema</i></span>, <span lang="la"><i>poesis</i></span> to Scaliger or
Maggi. Fifty people might have independently
thought of the first; and
the second is an application of a “common
form” nearly as old as rhetoric.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r281'>281</a>. P. 27. “The <cite>Tamerlanes</cite> and
<cite>Tamerchams</cite> of the late age, which
had nothing in them but the scenical
strutting and furious vociferation to

noting that Jonson thought there was
more than this in Marlowe; and that
the early edd. of <cite>Tamburlaine</cite> are
anonymous.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f282'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r282'>282</a>. One cannot but remember—with
pity or glee, according to mood and
temperament—how the Bacon-Shakespeare-maniacs
have actually taken this
in the sense of <em>poetic</em> “numbers.” But
in truth their study is not likely to be
much in haughty Rome and its language,
or to have led them either to
Petronius and his <span lang="la"><i>omnium nume[ro]rum</i></span>,
or to Seneca and his <span lang="la"><i>insolenti Græciæ</i></span>.</p>

the space given to the men of Eliza
and our James, by including the merer
grammarians and pedagogues, from
Mulcaster to that fervid Scot, Mr
Hume, who, in 1617, extolled the
“Orthography and Congruity” of his
native speech (ed. Wheatley, E.E.T.S.,
1865). Of Mulcaster, however, it deserves
to be mentioned that, not so
much in his <cite>Positions</cite> (1581: ed. Quick,
London, 1887), which have been, as in
his <cite>Elementarie</cite>, which should be, reprinted,
he displays a more than
Pléiade enthusiasm for the vernacular.
Unluckily this last is not easy of access,
even the B.M. copy being a

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>INTERCHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The proper appreciation of the period surveyed in the foregoing
Book is of perhaps greater importance than that of any other
part of this History. We have seen, in the three preceding
Interchapters, what it was that prevented Greek, Roman, and
Mediæval criticism respectively from attaining completeness,
and how the preventives worked. We saw further, in the last
pages of the First Volume, in what condition literature, and at
least the possibilities of the criticism of literature, were left at
the beginning of the Renaissance. And now we have seen
what additions the Renaissance made—not, indeed, in detail, to
literature itself, for that belongs to another story than ours, but
what additions it made—to the criticism of literature. In
mere bulk these additions were very considerable. The extant
critical writing of these hundred years (or rather of the last
seventy of them), excluding mere rhetorical schoolbooks, probably
exceeds, and very largely exceeds, the total of classical and
mediæval work on the subject which we possess, even inclusive
of schoolbooks. For the very first time Criticism, not as a sort
of half accidental and more than half shame-faced extension of
Rhetoric, but in and for itself, received a really large share of
the intellectual attention of the period.</p>

<p class='c000'>Moreover, the advantages possessed by Renaissance critics
(as we partly also saw in the place referred to) were likewise
very great. Men were beginning really to know and really to
understand antiquity; they had the whole body of mediæval
literature complete, finished, ready for their appreciation; and
they or their contemporaries were daily and yearly building up
great literatures in all the principal countries of Europe, except
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>Germany, and not wholly despicable literatures there and elsewhere.
The excuse of the want of comparison, which had been
valid for Greece, less valid but still partly so for Rome, and
valid again, though for different reasons, in the Middle Ages,
was dwindling and disappearing every day. There was no want
of interest in the subject; there was no want of examples, both
encouraging and warning, of method.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor is it possible to deny that the actual accomplishment of
the time was very considerable likewise. When a century finds
a certain department of intellectual activity almost uncultivated;
when it leaves that subject in a state of active cultivation;
and when, further, two following centuries are content to
opine almost wholly in the sense to which it has generally
inclined,—that century can hardly be said to have wasted its
years. Accomplishment—very remarkable and solid accomplishment—it
can certainly boast. It must be the business of
this Interchapter to examine the nature and (partly at least)
the value of that accomplishment, now that we have fully surveyed
its items, and frankly admitted a certain general result.</p>

<p class='c000'>In considering the critical achievement of Italy, the earliest
in time, the most abundant in result, the most influential—in
fact an abridgment, and no mean abridgment, of that of
Europe—we cannot but see at once that there was a certain
disadvantage accompanying the inevitableness and the general
propriety of this Italian prerogative. No other country had so
much learning; but, for this very reason, no other country was
so certain rather to over- than to under-value the importance
of ancient doctrine. No country had so perfect a literature,
though other countries had literatures older, richer, and more
vigorous; but this very perfection, while it might seem to provide
a fertile field for criticism, had two dangers. The Italians
were likely to look down upon, or simply to ignore, other literatures;
and, from the failing, though slowly and not conspicuously
failing, force of their creative power, they were likely to turn to
logomachies and debating-society wrangles. Nay, there was a
third peril. No country had so little properly mediæval literature
as Italy; and none therefore was more certain to set the
fashion of ignoring or slighting that mediæval performance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>which is so invaluable as a check and balance-redresser. And
perhaps we might even add a fourth—that while French and
English had got practically beyond the reach of mere dialect-jealousy,
Italian had not; and that too much of the abundant
interest in literature was throughout turned upon mere grammar
and mere linguistics.</p>

<p class='c000'>Perhaps for these reasons, perhaps for others, perhaps for
none assignable except by superfluous guess-work, Italian
criticism, active and voluminous as it was, settled very early
into certain well-marked limits and channels, and almost wholly
confined itself within them, though these channels underwent
no infrequent intersection or confluence.</p>

<p class='c000'>The main texts and patterns of the critics of the Italian
Renaissance were three—the <span lang="la"><cite>Ars Poetica</cite></span> of Horace, the <cite>Poetics</cite>
of Aristotle, and the various Platonic places dealing with
poetry. These latter had, as we have seen, begun to affect
Italian thought, directly or by transmission through this or
that medium, before the close of the fourteenth century; and
the maintenance of the Platonic ban, the refutation of it, or the
more or less ingenious acceptance and evasion of it, with the
help of the Platonic blessing, had been a tolerably familiar
exercise from the time of Boccaccio to the time of Savonarola.
But Horace and Aristotle gave rules and patterns of much more
definiteness. Of the writers of the abundant critical literature
which has been partly surveyed, some directly comment these
texts; others follow them with more or less selection or combination;
many take up separate questions suggested by them;
very few, if any, face the subject without some prepossession
derived from them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The very earliest regular criticism, as in Vida and the first
books of Trissino, is either strictly grammatical and formal or
else tends to expatiate further in the Horatian path of rather
desultory practical hints for composition, these latter usually
tending towards a more or less slavish “Follow the ancients.”
But, from the time of Daniello onwards, more abstract views
and questionings, especially in the direction of a sort of Eirenicon
between Aristotle and Plato, begin to engage the attention
of critics, sometimes as a prelude to study of formal Poetics,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>sometimes to the exclusion of this. The most thoroughgoing
as well as about the ablest example of this latter kind is
probably the <cite>Naugerius</cite> of Fracastoro, where this distinguished
physician and physicist, himself a skilled versifier and even
something of a poet, scarcely touches poets and poetry in the
concrete more than he might in a dialogue on physics or metaphysics,
and is entirely occupied with questions of the extremest
“metapoetic,” or metacriticism.</p>

<p class='c000'>This kind of discussion, which is prominent in the whole body
of critics from Daniello to Summo, is, with its extensions in the
direction of the Theory of the Drama, the Theory of the Heroic
Poem, &#38;c., no doubt the most characteristic, and perhaps even
the constitutive, feature of Italian criticism. It seems to have
been that which most attracted foreign scholars, and stirred
them up to emulation; it is very rarely omitted altogether by
anybody, save the merest grammarians. In fact, it so impressed
itself, during this period, upon the imagination, the memory,
the intellectual habit, not merely of Italy but of Europe, that
to this day critics who neglect it are looked at askance by many,
if not by most, of their fellows.</p>

<p class='c000'>Questions, however, more practical than these, yet not of
quite such extreme practicality as the mere questions of
grammar and dialect, of metric and composition, did actually
occupy the Italians. About the middle of the century the
lucubrations of Cinthio and Pigna on the question of the
Romances and their relation to Epic and to the Aristotelian
system, opened up the most promising prospect by far that had
ever yet been disclosed to criticism. Had these inquiries been
followed up—had they been extended from the Romance to the
<span lang="it"><i>novella</i></span>, which had already become such a feature of Italian
vernacular literature—had Italy provided something not less
vigorous, but more polished, than the English Interlude and
romantic mystery of the <cite>Mary Magdalene</cite> type, or the French
<span lang="fr"><i>farce</i></span> and <span lang="fr"><i>sotie</i></span>, so that a similar investigation might have been
further extended to drama—there is no saying what might not
have been achieved. But this was not permitted.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a matter of fact, the times were not ready, nor the
circumstances. The profitable promise of the discussion on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>the <span lang="it"><i>romanzi</i></span> dwindled off into the mere logomachies or personalities
of the <cite>Gerusalemme</cite> controversy, and into endless
formula-making for the abstract Heroic Poem. But little trace
of it is seen on the vigorous and independent mind of Castelvetro;
less on the equally vigorous, still more independent,
but perhaps rather more scholastic, mind of Patrizzi. For the
former, Aristotle is still the special though not quite the
exclusive battleground, or canvas, or whatever metaphor may
be preferred; and he labours—as all these Italians do, in strange
apparent, though perhaps not real, contrast to the vagueness
and far-reaching sweep of their more abstract inquiries—under
a difficulty, under a seeming impossibility, of getting beyond
disjointed observations and comments on Aristotle, Homer,
Dante, Petrarch, into a fruitful and satisfying critical study
of any poem or poet. Scaliger drills the whole mob of formal
and theoretical particulars into an orderly regiment, indulges
in plentiful criticism of the verbal and occasional kind, attempts
to take a (for him) complete historic survey, and achieves
at least a quasi-tiebeam, a bastard unity, for his work by his
all-pervading, uncompromising Virgil-worship, which gives a
test for everything, an answer for everything, a standard
always at hand. Patrizzi seems, with his double method of
historical survey and argumentative inquiry, to have at last
unbarred the very gates of the true path. But he does not
proceed far along it; and astonishingly sound as well as
original as are many of his conclusions, he hardly attempts
to apply them to modern poetry, except in the <cite>Trimerone</cite>,
where he is too much entangled in the special quibbles and
squabbles of the controversy to which it belongs. All the rest—even
interesting people like Minturno—sometimes peep over
the wall, yet confine their actual walk within it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Between all the schools, and from among the welter of the
individuals, there arises, in the mysterious way in which such
things do arise, and which defies all but shallow and superficial
explanation, a sort of general critical creed, every particular
article of which would probably have been signed by no two
particular persons—perhaps by no one—but which is ready to
become, and in the next century does become, orthodox and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>accepted as a whole.  And this creed runs somewhat as
follows:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>On the higher and more abstract questions of poetry
(which are by no means to be neglected) Aristotle is the
guide; but the meaning of Aristotle is not always self-evident
even so far as it goes, and it sometimes requires
supplementing. Poetry is the imitation of nature: but
this imitation may be carried on either by copying nature
as it is or by inventing things which do not actually
exist, and have never actually existed, but which conduct
themselves according to the laws of nature and reason.
The poet is <i>not</i> a public nuisance, but quite the contrary.
He must, however, both delight <i>and</i> instruct.</p>

<p class='c000'>As for the Kinds of poetry, they are not mere working
classifications of the practice of poets, but have technically
constituting definitions from which they might be independently
developed, and according to which they ought
to be composed. The general laws of Tragedy are given
by Aristotle; but it is necessary to extend his prescription
of Unity so as to enjoin three species—of Action,
Time, and Place. Tragedy must be written in verse,
which, though not exactly the constituting form of poetry
generally, is almost or quite inseparable from it. The
illegitimacy of prose in Comedy is less positive. Certain
extensions of the rules of the older Epic may be admitted,
so as to constitute a new Epic or Heroic Poem; but it is
questionable whether this may have the full liberty of
Romance, and it is subject to Unity, though not to the
dramatic Unity. Other Kinds are inferior to these.</p>

<p class='c000'>In practising them, and in practising all, the poet is to
look first, midmost, and last to the practice of the
ancients. “The ancients” may even occasionally be contracted
to little more than Virgil; they may be extended
to take in Homer, or may be construed much more widely.
But taking things on the whole, “the ancients” have anticipated
almost everything, and in everything that they
have anticipated have done so well that the best chance
of success is simply to imitate them. The detailed precepts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>of Horace are never to be neglected; if supplemented,
they must be supplemented in the same sense.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>It is less the business of the historian, after drawing up this
creed, to criticise it favourably or unfavourably, than to point
out that it had actually, by the year 1600, come very near to
formulated existence. We shall find it in actual formulation in
the ensuing book; we have already seen it in more than
adumbration, governing the pronouncements of a scholar and a
man of genius like Ben Jonson thirty years later than the close
of the sixteenth century. A full estimate of its merits and
demerits must be postponed to the close of this volume. But
it may be observed at once that it is, <span lang="la"><i>prima facie</i></span>, not a
perfect creed by any means. It has (and this, I think, has
been too seldom noticed) a fault, almost, if not quite, as
great on the <span lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span> side as that which it confessedly has
on the <span lang="la"><i>a posteriori</i></span>. It does not face the facts; it blinks
all mediæval and a great deal of existing modern literature.
But, then, to do it justice, it does not pretend
to do other than blink them. The fault in its own more
special province is much more glaring, though, as has been said,
it has, by a sort of sympathy, been much more ignored. There
is no real connection between the higher and the lower principles
of Neo-Classicism. There is not merely one crevasse, not
easily to be crossed, in this glacier of Correctness; there are two
or three. Let us, for argument’s sake, concede all the points in
Fracastoro’s <span lang="it"><cite>Naugerius</cite></span>, the Aconcagua or Everest of the school.
Let us allow that to the real lover of poetry it skills not much
whether he grants or denies all its propositions. But how are
we to pass from these to the further group—to allow that
Reason, Common-Sense, Nature, will govern the poet’s mediate
and lower necessities? How from this, again, to the still other
group of dramatic, heroic, miscellaneous requirements of the
Correct? How from any of them to the entirely arbitrary
warning clause that the ancients have actually or virtually
anticipated everything?</p>

<p class='c000'>On the more obvious faults of Italian criticism in detail—its
extravagant Virgil-worship; its refusal (except in such rare and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>practically isolated cases as Lilius Giraldus’ knowledge of
Chaucer and Wyatt, Patrizzi’s of Fauchet and his Old French
subjects) to take any account of foreign modern literature; its
coterie-squabbling and the rest, it would not be profitable to
dwell much. But it is curious and instructive to notice how
little appreciative criticism of contemporaries this active critical
period gives. If you start a controversy of an ancient against
a modern or a modern against a modern—of Homer against
Ariosto, or of Ariosto against Tasso—there will be plenty of
persons to take a hand. For a really <em>appreciative</em> study of any
writer, modern or ancient, I do not know where to look. Men
are so besotted, on the one hand, with their inquiries into
general principles; on the other, with their sporadic annotations,
that they cannot attempt anything of the kind.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet it would be an act of the grossest injustice and ingratitude
to refuse or to stint recognition of the immense services
that the Italians rendered to criticism at this time. It was, in
their own stately word, a veritable case of <span lang="it"><i>risorgimento</i></span>; and of
resurrection in a body far better organised, far more gifted, than
that which had gone to sleep a thousand years before.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the year 1500 we may look over Europe and find criticism
really alive and awake <span lang="la"><i>nusquam et nullibi</i></span>—at best fast asleep,
and dreaming a little with the dreams of Gavin Douglas or (had
he lived a couple of years longer) of Savonarola, or of such
more infantine persons as Augustine Käsenbrot. In 1600
criticism is a classed and recognised department of literature;
Faustino Summo, in the very year, can quote authority after
authority, refer—as to a sort of common law of the subject—to
<span lang="la"><i>dicta</i></span> and <span lang="la"><i>obiter dicta</i></span> of nearly three generations of distinguished
judges. And Italian criticism has colonised: its colonies, with
the virtues of that kind, are showing characteristics sometimes
quite different, though derived from those of the mother country,
and are carrying the critical torch round the world. No matter
for the moment whether the more perfect way has been reached,
or the less perfect way declined upon. The time of “liking
grossly,” of composing anyhow, has passed: that of critical
study of the old, and critical reception of the new, has begun.</p>

<p class='c000'>Never, therefore, shall I join in the anathema in which De
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>Quincey<a id='r285'></a><a href='#f285' class='c019'><sup>[285]</sup></a> has coupled Italian critics with Greek rhetoricians.
In fact, the Italians suffer far more unjustly than the Greeks.
Castelvetro and Patrizzi alone would be enough to clear their
company handsomely: Capriano, Cinthio Giraldi, Minturno
could put in quite sufficient bail on their own recognisances:
yet others would leave the court more than recommended to
mercy.<a id='r286'></a><a href='#f286' class='c019'><sup>[286]</sup></a> I disagree with many of the principles of most of them;
I wish that even those with whom I agree had opened their
eyes wider, kept them more steadily on the object, and
cared less about fighting abstract prizes, and more about
appreciating the goods which the gods had given them in
concrete literature. It was also a misfortune, no doubt, that no
man of very distinct genius and whole-hearted devotion gave
himself up to the business. Vida was a good kind of pedant,
and Trissino at heart a philologist; Daniello, Capriano, and
most of the rest, including even Minturno, down to Denores
and Summo, persons of respectable talent merely; Fracastoro, a
man of science; Cinthio, a novelist and miscellanist; Scaliger,
a not quite so good kind of more deeply-dyed pedant; Castelvetro,
a scholar, with the scholar’s quarrelsomeness; Patrizzi, a
philosopher primarily; Torquato Tasso himself, a great poet,
with, for a poet, a sensible and logical but curiously timid and
hesitating mind. Not a few of them did great things for
Criticism; all together they did a really mighty thing for her
and for Literature: but they were not her sworn servants, as
Lessing and Hazlitt, as Sainte-Beuve and Arnold, were later.</p>

<p class='c000'>Let there be to them not the less but almost the more glory!
It is something—nay, it is very much—to have created a Kind.
Up to their time Criticism had been a mere Cinderella in the
literary household. Aristotle had taken her up as he had
taken all Arts and Sciences. The Rhetoricians had found her a
useful handmaid to Rhetoric. Roman <span lang="it"><i>dilettanti</i></span> had dallied with
her. The solid good sense and good feeling of Quintilian had
decided that she must be “no casual mistress but a wife”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>(perhaps on rather polygamic principles) to the student of
oratory. Longinus had suddenly fixed her colours on his
helmet, and had ridden in her honour the most astonishing
little <span lang="fr"><i>chevauchée</i></span> in the annals of adventurous literature. The
second greatest poet of the world had done her at once
yeoman’s service and stately courtesy. And yet she was, in
the general literary view, not so much <span lang="fr"><i>déclassée</i></span> as not classed
at all—not “out,” not accorded the <span lang="fr"><i>entrées</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was now all over. The country which gave the literary
tone and set the literary fashions of Europe had adopted Criticism
in the most unmistakable manner—whether in the manner
wisest or most perfect is not for the present essential. Rank
thus given is never lost; at any rate, there is no recorded
instance of a literary attainder for Kinds, whatever there may
be for persons.</p>

<p class='c004'>When this criticism passes the Alps, and we pass them with
it, a curious difference is to be perceived. We leave the
abstract side of the matter almost wholly behind us—the most
abstract side perhaps wholly. A little of the Platonic generalities,
relieved from the Platonic detraction, may be indulged
in <span lang="la"><i>pro forma</i></span>, and Vauquelin (in that odd <a id='corr220.21'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='familarity'>familiarity</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_220.21'><ins class='correction' title='familarity'>familiarity</ins></a></span> with Deity
which the French have always displayed) may image God as a
gardener ordering the garden of Poesy with trim walks, and
neatly planted beds, and hedges, which must not be trespassed
on, or from, or through. But the French attention almost
wholly deserts such things for the mediate generalities of kind
and form; and is constantly tempted to desert these also for
the still lower and more particular questions of language,
prosody, and style. The fact is, that the circumstances have
entirely changed. The Italians, though they may not know it,
are in a state of declining vitality and creative force as regards
actual literature; even Tasso is an “old man’s child” among
their greatest. Besides, to do them justice, there is very little
left for them to do with their mere means of language and the
like. It is quite different with French and Frenchmen. If
they are rashly neglectful (and Fauchet, Pasquier, and others
are soon on the spot to vindicate them to some extent from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>this neglect) of their further past, there is some excuse for
impatience of the past that is nearer; and it is even natural
and human, though far from praiseworthy, that they should
scorn the once charming formal devices which latterly, in most
hands, have been so destitute of charm. But make allowance
as we may for the causes, the facts remain. French criticism
is much the least important of the three divisions which we
have considered in the foregoing book. Not only does it begin
late; not only does it fail to be very fertile; but its individual
documents require a certain kindness to speak very highly of
their virtues, and a good deal of blindness to conceal their
shortcomings. I have protested above against a too low
estimate of the critical value of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Défense et Illustration</cite></span>. Its
critical interest is really great, and its critical importance
really high; but this greatness and this importance are
scarcely absolute. They belong to it as to one of our very
first pieces of <em>revolutionary</em> criticism—one of the first in which
the newly hatched and fledged critical spirit of Europe shows
itself of falcon breed, and sets out to fight and destroy as well
as to build nests and hatch young in its turn. The censure of
the <span lang="fr"><cite>Défense</cite></span> is very mainly unjust, and its positive doctrine,
though generous, and, in the circumstances, not insalutary, is
vague, not very far-sighted, and, at the very best, extremely
incomplete. What saves it is, first, the abundant and conclusive
evidence that it gives of the critic being actually abroad in
earnest, of the time of mere acquiescence and tradition having
ceased, of there being writers who are determined to attack
some kinds of writing and encourage others with their very
best will and power; and, secondly, the generous and uncompromising
championship of the vernacular, which is the
greatest glory of the Pléiade, and which, followed in other
countries, gave us the great modern literatures. Du Bellay
has the credit of bringing criticism, if we may so speak, nearer
to her true object than almost any Italian critic of his own
century had done, though he does not himself either practise
or prescribe the best way of getting at that object.</p>

<p class='c000'>The criticism of his colleague, or master, Ronsard, is, as we
have seen, injured by its small bulk, by its rather fragmentary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>character, by the fact that the most considerable piece of it
has passed through another hand, and that we have only that
hand’s own testimony for the faithfulness of the rehandling,
and by not a little decided inconsistency. But it has the same
militant, practical spirit as Du Bellay’s in quality, and more of
it in proportional quantity. Moreover, it is extremely <em>germinal</em>.
Those<a id='r287'></a><a href='#f287' class='c019'><sup>[287]</sup></a> who contend that the classical French criticism of the
seventeenth century was only the Pléiade criticism of the
sixteenth, denying its masters, omitting some, if not always
the worst, parts of their creed, narrowed in range, and perfected
in apparent system, have a great deal to say for themselves.
Nor can there be reasonable doubt that, though Du
Bellay was the first to speak critically, the teaching was the
teaching of Ronsard throughout. Of this teaching, the injunction
to enrich the language by archaism, and dialect, and word-coining
(even by reading the forgotten romances of Arthur),
was the very best part, and the first to be discarded by the
ingratitude of the rebellious disciples, Malherbe and those
about him. The worst part, which was not discarded but
retained, was the adoption of the Italian doctrines about the
hybrid kind of “Heroic” or “Long” Poem. But in most
points the criticism of Ronsard justifies itself by a real adherence,
conscious or unconscious, to the practical ideals of the
French.</p>

<p class='c000'>These characteristics recur (to much greater advantage,
because of its far greater bulk, and in spite of its flagrant
desultoriness) in the work of Vauquelin de la Fresnaye. Here
we have, put certainly not with much method, but with plenty
of talent, and at no unsuitable length, the whole of the Italian
teaching, in small points and in large, that had commended
itself to the French mind up to this time, with such additions,
adaptations, and corrections as vernacular needs had induced,
or vernacular genius insisted on. We see in it, very decidedly,
the obsession of the “long poem,” which France was not to
outgrow for two centuries. We see the tendency to burden
criticism with innumerable petty “rules” (or with attentions
to “licence” nearly as burdensome), which was also to beset
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>the nation. And in general we see also what it may not be
improper (in connection with a school so fond of neologism
and word-imitation) to call the “pottering” tendency, which
was the worse side of Pléiade criticism. Vauquelin has really
a great deal to say, and much of what he has to say is sensible.
He escapes many errors of his forerunners, more of his
successors, and it is comparatively seldom that one feels
inclined to put an absolute black mark against any of his
suggestions or cautions. But the whole is not only formless,
but also invertebrate. Vauquelin does not, like some of the
Italians, confine himself to grave and lofty generalisations on
the highest questions affecting Poetry. He does not, like others,
or these same at other moments, take an orderly survey of
detail according to a coherent scheme. He simply has, as the
cant phrase goes, “a few remarks to offer” on much more than
a few points.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been already said that this provisional, tentative, and
somewhat ineffectual character is characteristic, and prophetically
characteristic, of the school. The Pléiade did not, like
Ronsard’s slightly younger contemporary Spenser and his followers
in England, set French poetry once for all on the path
on which, with whatever minor changes, it was henceforth to
go. Some thirty or forty years of never wholly successful
experiment were succeeded by an unjust supplanting, and by
another thirty or forty of random tentatives, corresponding in
some ways to those of England nearly a century earlier. Only
then did France fall into a way, not by any means of perfection,
but sufficiently suited to her genius to enable her to travel
fast and far in it. It is a serious thing for Pléiade criticism
that we have from it no thorough examination of any part
of French literature. No doubt such examinations are not
the strong point of Renaissance Criticism. But generally there
is more approach to them in Italian, with the scattered remarks
of the critics on Dante and Petrarch, with the controversies
about the <span lang="it"><i>romanzi</i></span> in general and the <cite>Orlando</cite> and <cite>Gerusalemme</cite>
in particular; there is more even in English, with the surveys,
imperfect as they are, of the earlier Elizabethans over the past
of poetry, with the literature of the “classical metres” quarrel,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>with the (no doubt later) remarks of Ben on Shakespeare and
others. The fault of Pléiade Criticism, in short, is that it is
at once too particularist and too little particular.<a id='r288'></a><a href='#f288' class='c019'><sup>[288]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004'>Crossing the Channel, as we lately crossed the Alps, we do not
find a simple transmission of indebtedness. It would have been
surprising, considering the strong intellectual interests of the
Colet group, and the early presence in England of such a critical
force as Erasmus, if this country had waited to receive a
current merely transmitted through France from Italy. It is
possible that, later, Gascoigne may have derived something from
Ronsard, and it is quite certain that “E. K.'s” notes on the
<cite>Calendar</cite> show symptoms of Pléiade influence, even in the bad
point of contempt, or at least want of respect, for Marot. But
it is exceedingly improbable that Ascham derived any impulsion
from Du Bellay: it is certain, as we have seen, that he knew
Italian critics like Pigna directly; and it is equally certain
that, either by his own studies or through Cheke, his critical
impulses must have been excited humanistically long before the
French had got beyond the merely <span lang="fr"><i>rhétoriqueur</i></span> standard of
Sibilet.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hence, as well as for other reasons, English criticism develops
itself, if not with entire independence, yet with sufficient
conformity to its own needs. That practical bent which we
have noticed in the French shows itself here also; but it is conditioned
differently. We had, as they had in France, to fashion
a new poetic diction; but it cannot be said that the critics did
much for this: Spenser, as much as Coriolanus, might have
said, “Alone I did it.” They did more <span lang="la"><i>in re metrica</i></span>, and it so
happened that they had, quite in their own sphere, to fight
an all-important battle, the battle of the classical metres,
which was of nothing like the same importance in French or
in Italian. In dealing with these and other matters they fall
into certain generations or successive groups.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Ascham and his contemporaries the critical attitude was
induced, but not altogether favourably conditioned, by certain
forces, partly common to them with their Continental contemporaries,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>partly not. They all felt, in a degree most creditable
to themselves (and contrasting most favourably with the rather
opposite feeling of men so much greater and so much later as
Bacon and Hobbes), that they must adorn their Sparta, that it
was their business to get the vernacular into as good working
order, both for prose and verse, as they possibly could. And
what is more, they had some shrewd notions about the best way
of doing this. The exaggerated rhetoric and “aureateness” of
the fifteenth century had inspired them, to a man, with a horror
of “inkhorn terms,” and, if mainly wrong, they were also partly
right in feeling that the just and deserved popularity of the
early printed editions of the whole of Chaucer threatened English
with an undue dose of archaism.</p>

<p class='c000'>Further, they were provided by the New Learning, not
merely with a very large stock of finished examples of literature,
but also with a not inconsiderable library of regular
criticism. They did their best to utilise these; but, in thus
endeavouring, they fell into two opposite, yet in a manner complementary,
errors. In the first place, they failed altogether to
recognise the continuity, and in a certain sense the <span lang="fr"><i>equipollence</i></span>,
of literature—the fact that to blot out a thousand years of
literary history, as they tried to do, is unnatural and destructive.
In the second place, though their instinct told them rightly that
Greek and Latin had invaluable lessons and models for English,
their reason failed to tell them that these lessons must be
applied, these models used, with special reference to the nature,
the history, the development of English itself. Hence they fell,
as regards verse, into the egregious and fortunately self-correcting
error of the classical metres, as regards prose, into a fashion
of style, by no means insalutary, as a corrective and reaction
from the rhetorical bombast and clumsiness of the transition,
but inadequate of itself, and needing to be counterdosed by the
fustian and the familiarity which are the worse sides of Euphuism,
in order to bring about the next stage. Lastly, these men
looked too much to the future, and not enough to the past:
they did not so much as condescend to examine the literary
manner and nature even of Chaucer himself, still less of
others.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>In the next generation, which gives us Gascoigne, Webbe,
Puttenham, and Sidney, the same tendencies are perceived;
but the Euphuist movement comes in to differentiate them on
one side, and the influence of Italian criticism on the other.
The classical metre craze has not yet been blown to pieces by
the failure of even such a poet as Spenser to do any good
with it, the fortunate recalcitrance of the healthy English
spirit, and at last the crushing broadside of Daniel’s <cite>Defence of
Rhyme</cite>. But it does no very great practical harm: and prose
style is sensibly beautified and heightened. Some attempts are
made, from Gascoigne downwards, to examine the actual wealth
of English, to appraise writers, to analyse methods—attempts,
however, not very well sustained, and still conditioned by the
apparent ignorance of the writers that there was anything behind
Chaucer, though Anglo-Saxon was actually studied at the
time under Archbishop Parker’s influence. Further, the example
of the Italian critics deflects the energy of our writers
from the right way, and sends them off into pretty Platonisings
about the proud place due to poetry, the stately status of the
singer, and other agreeable but unpractical aberrations. This
tendency is much strengthened by the Puritan onslaught on
poetry generally and dramatic poetry in particular. In all this
there is a great deal of interest, and many scattered <span lang="fr"><i>aperçus</i></span> of
great value. Gascoigne’s little treatise is almost priceless, as
showing us how English prosody was drifting on the shallows
of a hard-and-fast syllabic arrangement, when the dramatists
came to its rescue. Sidney, wrong as he is about the drama,
catches hold of one of the very life-buoys of English poetry in
his praise of the ballad. Daniel’s <cite>Defence</cite> puts the root of the
rhyme-matter in the most admirable fashion. But we see
that the classics are exercising on all the men of the time influences
both bad and good, and in criticism, perhaps, rather
bad than good; that the obsession of Latin in particular is
heavy on them; and that the practice, both Latin and Greek,
of what we have called beginning at the wrong end lies
heaviest of all.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nothing will show this more curiously than the words in
which Sidney anticipated (and perhaps suggested) Ben’s censure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>of Spenser’s diction as to the <cite>Shepherd’s Calendar</cite>, especially if
we remember that this was said by a personal friend and by an
ardent lover of poetry. That there is something to be said
against the dialect of the <cite>Calendar</cite> all reasonable critics will
allow. As a poetic language it is, at its best, but a preliminary
exercise for the glorious medium of <cite>The Faerie Queene</cite>; it is
awkwardly and in some cases incorrectly blended; and, above
all, the <em>mere</em> rusticity—the “hey-ho” and the rest—is a
dangerous and doubtful expedient. But observe that Sidney
says nothing of this kind. He “looks merely at the stop-watch.”
Theocritus did not do it; Virgil did not do it;
Sannazar did not do it; therefore Spenser must not do it.
That his own elevation of a mere modern like Sannazar to
this position of a lawgiver of the most tyrannic kind—of
an authority not merely whose will is law, not merely whose
prohibition is final, but whose bare abstention from something
taboos that something from the use of all mankind for
ever and ever,—that this did not strike Sidney as preposterous
in itself, and as throwing doubt on the whole method,
is wonderful. But even if he had stopped at Theocritus and
Virgil, he would have been wrong enough. Here once more
is the False Mimesis, the <span lang="la"><i>prava imitatio</i></span>. Not only is the
good poet to be followed in what he does, but what he
does not do serves as a bar to posterity in all time from
doing it.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is another point in which Sidney and Ben are alike,
and in which they may even seem to anticipate that general
adoption of “Reason,” of “Good Sense” as the criterion, which
the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries claimed as their
own, and which some recent critics have rather kindly allowed
them. Sidney’s raillery of the romantic life-drama, Ben’s
reported strictures on the sea-coast of Bohemia, and his certain
ones on “Cæsar did never wrong,” &#38;c., express the very spirit
of this cheap rationalism, which was later to defray a little even
of Dryden’s criticism, almost the whole of Boileau’s, and far too
much of Pope’s. The ancients, to do them justice, are not
entirely to be blamed for this. There is very little of it in
Aristotle, who quite understands that the laws of poetry are not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>the laws of history or of science.<a id='r289'></a><a href='#f289' class='c019'><sup>[289]</sup></a> But there is a great deal of
it in Horace: and, as we shall see, the authority of the great
Greek was, during the three <a id='corr228.3'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='centures'>centuries</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_228.3'><ins class='correction' title='centures'>centuries</ins></a></span> which form the subject of
this volume, more and more used as a mere cloak for the
opinions of the clever Roman. Meanwhile, such books as those
of Webbe and Puttenham, such an ordeal by battle as that
fought out by Campion and Daniel, even such critical <span lang="la"><i>jaculata</i></span>
as those of Meres and Bolton,<a id='r290'></a><a href='#f290' class='c019'><sup>[290]</sup></a> were all in different ways doing
work, mistaken sometimes in kind, but always useful in general
effect.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the general Elizabethan position, as we have seen, Jonson
himself made no great advance: in fact, he threw fresh intrenchments
around it and fresh forces into its garrison. We may
even, contrary to our wont in such cases, be rather glad that he
did not enter upon a more extensive examination of his own
contemporaries, because it is quite clear that he was not at the
right point of view for making it. But it does not follow from
this that he was not a critic, and a great critic. No one who
was not this could have written the Shakespeare and the Bacon
passages—in fact, in the former case, only a great magnanimity
and a true sense of critical truth could have mixed so generous
an acknowledgment with the candid avowal of so much disapproval.
And, as we have said above, even where Ben was
wrong, or at least insufficient, his critical gospel was the thing
needed for the time to come, if not for the actual time. By a
few years after his own death—by the middle of the century,
that is to say—seventy years and more of such a harvest as no
other country has ever had, had filled the barns of English to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>bursting with the ripest crops of romantic luxuriance—its
treasure-houses with the gold and the ivory and the spices—if
sometimes also with the apes and the peacocks—of Romantic
exploration and discovery. There was no need to invite further
acquisition—the national genius, in Ben’s own quotation,
<span lang="la"><i>sufflaminandus erat</i></span>. It was his task to begin the sufflamination:
and he did it, not perhaps with a full apprehension of
the circumstances, and certainly with nothing like a full
appreciation of what the age, from its “<cite>Tamerlanes</cite> and
<cite>Tamerchams</cite>” onwards, had done; but still did it. In his
most remarkable book we see the last word of Elizabethan
criticism, not merely in point of time, but in the other sense.
Ben is beyond even Sidney, much more Webbe and Puttenham,
not to mention Ascham and Wilson, in grasp; while, if we
compare him with the Continental critics of his own time, he
shows a greater sense of real literature than almost any of
them. But, at the same time, he has not occupied the true
standing-ground of the critic; he has not even set his foot on it,
as Dryden, born before his death, was to do. In him, as in all
these Renaissance critics, we find, not so much positive errors
as an inability to perceive clearly where they are and what their
work is.</p>

<p class='c000'>Passing from the performances of the several countries<a id='r291'></a><a href='#f291' class='c019'><sup>[291]</sup></a> to
the general critical upshot of the century, as we passed to
those performances from the survey of individual works, we
have already secured one perception of result. Criticism is
once more constituted; it is constituted indeed much more
fully, if by no means more methodically, than has ever been
the case before. By the time of our last Italian writer, Faustino
Summo (Vauquelin is accidentally, and Ben Jonson not so
accidentally, later in the other countries, but neither represents
a stage so really advanced), Criticism has, besides its ancient
books of the Law, quite a library of modern prophets, commentators,
scribes. The strings of authorities, so specially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>dear to the coming century, can be produced without any
difficulty whatsoever: and however much these authorities
may differ on minor points, their general drift is unmistakable.
Isolated dissenters like Patrizzi may make good their
own fastnesses; but the general army hardly troubles itself to
besiege or even to mask them, it goes on its way to conquer and
occupy the land. Of the constitution established, or shortly to
be established, in the conquered districts, some sketch has been
given, but a caution should here once more be interposed
against taking the word “established” too literally. Still, all
the dogmas of the Neo-Classic creed, its appeal to the ancients
and its appeal to Reason or Nature or Sense, its strict view of
Kinds, its conception of Licence and Rule, its Unities, are more
or less clearly evolved. And fresh particulars—such as its
sharp reaction from the allowance and even recommendation
of terms of art, archaisms, &#38;c., which had been partly adopted
by some Italians and warmly championed by the Pléiade—are
at hand. Indeed, the business of the seventeenth century is,
according to the title which we have ventured to take for the
next book, much more to crystallise what is already passing out
of the states of digestion and solution—to codify precedent
case-law—than to do anything new.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is not only this important advance in at least poetical
theory to be considered, but also an advance still more important,
though as yet not formally marshalled and regimented,
in the direction of critical practice—of the application directly,
to books old and new, of the critical principles so arrived at.
We have seen that, for good and sufficient reasons, there was
not so very much of this in classical times proper, and that
there was so little of it as to be almost nothing in the Middle
Ages. It did not seem necessary, in the concluding chapters of
the first volume, to multiply proofs of this, as they could have
been multiplied, merely to display acquaintance with mediæval
literature. To take two fresh ones here, each famous for other
reasons, the well-known reference of Wolfram von Eschenbach
at the end of the <cite>Parzival</cite> to the “unrightness” of Chrestien
de Troyes’ version, and the godly wrath which made “Kyot”
set things in better order, contains no literary criticism at all;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>the matter, according to the usual mediæval habit, is looked
upon as a question of truth or falsehood, not of good or bad
literary presentment. And when the equally well-known but
anonymous scribe wrote jubilantly on the <span lang="la"><cite>Cursor Mundi</cite></span>,</p>

<p class='c008'>it is as certain as anything can be that he was not thinking, as
he might fairly have thought, of the not small skill in compilation
and narration displayed in that mighty miscellany, but
merely that it contained a great deal of useful instruction and
pleasant history. In the notices of books and writers which
accumulate during our present period this is more and more
ceasing to be the case; it has in fact ceased to be so from
almost the beginning.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such an estimate as that given by Ascham as Cheke’s of
Sallust simply could not have suggested itself to any mediæval
mind; the Humanist practice of the fifteenth century had—quite
early in the sixteenth—made it natural enough, at least
as regards ancient writers. And it was constantly becoming
more and more common as to moderns. The Italians, in a
limited and scholastic fashion, had begun it long before as to
Dante; they continued it in regard to Boccaccio and Petrarch;
they were spurred on to practise it more and more, first by the
immense popularity of the <cite>Orlando</cite>, and then by the rival (and
deliberately urged as rival) charms of the <cite>Gerusalemme</cite>. Compare
for one moment the survey of books and authors which we
quoted or summarised from the <cite>Labyrinthus</cite> in the last volume
with that which we have analysed from Lilius Giraldus in this—the
whole point of view, the whole method of handling, is
altered. In France and England more specially, attempts,
clumsy, limited, subject to whatever epithet of qualification
any one pleases to apply, as they may be, are made to take a
backward historical view of poetry at least; and when great
work such as Ronsard’s or Spenser’s is produced, there is a real,
if rudimentary, attempt made to judge it critically. By the
time that we reach Ben Jonson—who no doubt has a strong
tinge of the seventeenth century superinduced, by nature as
well as time, on his sixteenth-century nativity—such <span lang="fr"><i>aperçus</i></span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>almost of the highest critical kind in their species, as those on
Bacon and Shakespeare, are possible to at least the higher intellects,—it
needs but a step to the very highest kind, such as that
of Dryden on the same Shakespeare. That what we have called
the crystallisation of a critical creed affects these estimates not
always for the best is not of real importance—the point is that
we have at last got them.</p>

<p class='c000'>These are great things, but, still postponing criticism on this
criticism as a whole, we may point out one or two drawbacks
in it which already appear, and which are quite independent
of individual inclination on the vexed questions of Classic or
Romantic, Practice or Rule, Subject or Expression.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first is that, to some extent unavoidably, but to a greater
extent than that excuse will cover, the criticism which we have
reviewed is criticism of poetry only. Most of it is quite openly
and avowedly so. <span lang="la"><cite>Poetica</cite></span>, <span lang="la"><cite>Poetice</cite></span>, <span lang="la"><cite>De Poetica</cite></span>, <span lang="it"><cite>Della Poetica</cite></span>,
<span lang="it"><cite>Della Vera Poetica</cite></span>, <span lang="fr"><cite>Art Poétique</cite></span>, <cite>Art of Poetry</cite>, <cite>Apology for
Poetry</cite>—these are the very titles of the books we have been
discussing. When prose comes in at all, except on rare and
mostly late occasions, it is only on questions more abstract or
less abstract connected with poetry—“Whether Tragedy and
Comedy may be written in Prose,” “Whether Verse is necessary
to Poetry,” and the like. If poetry in ancient days was, though
it received plenty of attention, sometimes injuriously postponed
to oratory, it certainly now has its revenge. Oratory itself,
though occasionally handled, obviously is so as a sort of legacy
from the ancients themselves, from a sort of feeling that it
would not be decent to say nothing about a subject on which
Aristotle, and Cicero, and Quintilian have said so much. The
formal Letter, being rather a favourite Italian institution, is not
quite neglected; it receives some attention among ourselves
from Ben. Whether History can or must give subjects for
poetry is keenly debated; but the question is approached
entirely from the side of interest in Poetry, not in History.
At the very close of our period, we find so great a prose writer
as Bacon doubting the solvency of vernacular prose; a little
earlier we find Montaigne taking note of it chiefly, if at all, in
regard to matter, Pasquier hardly taking notice of it at all.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>This is unfortunate, because it tends further to perpetuate
the mischievous absorption in Kinds, and to postpone the
attainment of the position from which, though the difference
between prose and poetry may be seen more sharply than ever,
the common literary qualities of both, and the way in which
they affect the delight of the receiver, are at last perceived. It
is unfortunate, further, because it tends to prevent the enjoyment
of the full advantages which the modern literatures are
gradually giving to the critic in the very departments—the
prose romance, the essay, and others—where ancient criticism
suffered most from the absence of material.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another drawback which it may seem captious, or ungenerous,
or even childish, to urge, but which really has a great deal
to do with the matter, is that, active as the period was in
criticism, it did not produce a single very great critic practising
on a great scale. Its four or five critics of greatest literary
genius were (I exclude Bacon for reasons given, and Spenser
hardly comes in) Ronsard, Du Bellay, Tasso, Sidney, and Ben
Jonson. The two Frenchmen dealt with but a small part of
the subject, and from but a special point of view; Tasso was
mainly “fighting a prize,” and his own prize; Sidney’s was a very
little tractate of general, if generous, protest, and entered into no
applications; Ben’s critical remains are un-co-ordinated notes.
On the other hand, of the specially critical writers, Scaliger on
the strictly erudite and strictly classical side, Castelvetro in a sort
of middle station, and Patrizzi as a voice crying in the wilderness,
are perhaps the only three who rise distinctly above
mediocrity. And, as has been pointed out already, Scaliger
is too much of a pedant, Castelvetro is a mere commentator,
and Patrizzi a philosopher militant, who carries on one of his
campaigns in the province of criticism.</p>

<p class='c000'>The disadvantages of this are twofold. Not merely do we
get no brilliant and, at least in appearance and claim, authoritative
exposition of the subject, like that of Boileau or that of
Pope later on the dogmatic side, like those of Dryden and Johnson
on the illustrative and exemplifying; but the whole critical
system comes into existence by a process of haphazard accretion—by
(to repeat a metaphor already used) an accumulation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>of individual judgments at common law. No doubt this gives
a certain strength, a certain naturalness, to the creed when it is
formed. It has not been foisted on the <span lang="la"><i>communis sensus</i></span>—that
<span lang="de"><cite>sensus</cite></span> has been inured and trained to it. The extraordinary
toughness and vitality of the resultant is very likely due to
this. But it caused also some of that inconsistency and apparent
irrationality which a system of common law almost
necessarily contracts as it grows: and it was more and more
driven to throw over these inconsistencies and irrationalities
that cloak of factitious Reason, or Sense, or Nature which, by
the eighteenth century, becomes the mere threadbare disguise
of a decrepit Duessa.</p>

<p class='c000'>If, and when, we arrive at the close of that century, after a
somewhat shorter halt and survey at the termination of the
seventeenth, when the deaths of Boileau and Dryden made a
real break—we shall have to complete this necessarily partial
view of the whole Neo-Classic dispensation. We have seen it
here in its Period of Origins, and, without endeavouring to add
too many strokes to the picture, we may point to the fresh
illustration of that principle which has been adumbrated (I
fear, from some remarks of good critics, with insufficient perspicuity)
at the close of the last volume. We saw that the
tendency of Greek criticism was good, because, whether it was
perfect criticism in itself or not, it was exactly the criticism
needed yet further to perfect the perfections of Greek literature;
and that much the same was the case in Latin. We saw
that the quiescence of Criticism in Mediæval times permitted
the gracious wilding of mediæval art to flourish unchecked and
fill the waste places of the field. But here we see a new thing,
hinted at before, the opposition, that is to say, of criticism to at
least the best creation. Sidney’s dramatic criticism simply
would, if it could, sweep Shakespeare from <span lang="la"><i>rerum natura</i></span>, and
he looks half askance at the work of his own familiar friend
Spenser. Ben would put the “<cite>Tamerlanes</cite> and <cite>Tamerchams</cite>”
in the dustbin. To that untamable Romantic luxuriance which
makes the glory of English literature at the time, which gives
French most of its actual strength, and which, in failing
measure, still supports the pride of Italy, the general tendency
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>of Renaissance criticism opposes a perpetual <a id='corr235.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Thou'>“Thou</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_235.1'><ins class='correction' title='Thou'>“Thou</ins></a></span> shalt
not.” It is not too much heeded—that would have been disastrous;
but it is heeded to some extent, and that is salutary. A
kind of check is put on the too wild curvetings, the too meteoric
flights, of Pegasus. There was always the danger that <cite>Jeronimo</cite>
at the beginning and Cleveland at the end might have too truly
expressed our own great age; that the odd word-coinage of
the Pléiade, and the tasteless rococo stuff of French literature
about 1640, might have done the same for France. Against this
the critics raised unceasing voices; and, though the voices were
sometimes those of geese, they really did something to save the
Capitol.</p>

is evidently speaking of “Italian”
critics in the vernacular. I hope he
was not thinking of Tasso here, or of
Gravina later: but the seventeenth
and eighteenth century men are certainly
in more danger of his judgment.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f287'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r287'>287</a>. M. Pellissier and others have taken this line.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f288'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r288'>288</a>. Some exception ought, perhaps, to be made for Pasquier: but not much.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f289'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r289'>289</a>. Yet even he does condescend to it
too much in his notices of “objections”
towards the end of the <cite>Poetics</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f290'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r290'>290</a>. These judgments might of course
be reinforced enormously by extracts
from letters and poems commendatory,
as well as from substantive examples,
of Elizabethan literature, prose or
verse. But this is just one of the
points in which the constantly increasing
pressure of material makes abstinence,
or at least rigid temperance,
necessary as we come downwards.
Some very notable passages in creative
works—Shakespeare’s remarks on
drama among the more, and Ben’s
on “men’s and women’s poets” among
the less—are glanced at elsewhere:
Webster’s famous “catalogue <em>dé</em>raisonné”
(yet not wholly so) of his great
companions, and his odd confession of
inability to manage “the passionate
and weighty <span lang="la"><i>nuntius</i></span>,” tempts fuller
notice. But one must refrain.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f291'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r291'>291</a>. It has seemed better to reserve
Sturm, Fabricius, and the few other
critics of sixteenth-century Germany,
till the next Book, for reasons there to
be exposed. The reasons for similarly
putting off the Spaniards have already
been touched upon: and the minor
nations do not press.</p>

<p class='c026'>The causes of the transference of the course of critical empire,
northwards as well as westwards, from Italy to France, in the
seventeenth century, lie (except in so far as they
will body themselves forth in the plain tale of this
course which follows) somewhat outside the plan
which has been traced for our History. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The supplanting of Italy by France.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> They belong,
in part at least, to that “metacritic” and guesswork
which we endeavour to exclude. Indeed, as usually, and more
than as usually, in such case, the old puzzle of “the egg from
the Owl, or the Owl from the egg?” besets us specially in this
division of the History of that Art for which some have had it
that the bird of Pallas is a specially suitable symbol. We can
see the importance of the establishment of the French Academy,
when only the first third of the century had passed, of the
extraordinary influence of coteries like that of the Hotel
Rambouillet, of the coincidence of the towering ambition of a
youthful king and the concentrated force of his at least partially
reunited kingdom, with the existence of a remarkable knot of
great men of letters, including one critic of the most masterful,
if not quite the most masterly, type. But can there
possibly be any causation in this latter coincidence? Can we
say why Conrart’s Academy, instead of lasting for a time and
then breaking up, became a national institution? why the
Rambouillet blue-stockings were more influential than those
who haunted Mrs Montagu’s peacock-room, or put rubbish
into the Bath-Easton vase? Only by guessing, or by arguing in
stately circle about national temperaments. And we endeavour
to avoid both these things here.<a id='r292'></a><a href='#f292' class='c019'><sup>[292]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>What is certain is, that while on the one hand Italy is

critics, in the seventeenth century than in the
sixteenth, and while the authority of Scaliger,
Castelvetro, Minturno, Piccolomini, is felt<a id='r293'></a><a href='#f293' class='c019'><sup>[293]</sup></a> all over
Europe, the contemporary practitioners of the art
exercise no such authority, and are of almost the least importance.
A page for every score that we gave them in the
last Book will nearly suffice in this. In France, on the other
hand, no part of the century is not full of the critical labour,
and no part is without critics to whom, whether we grant the
epithets “good” or “great” or not, we cannot possibly refuse
those of “important,” “influential”—in more than one or two
cases even “epoch-making.” In the first generation we have
the half-revolution, half-reaction of Malherbe, who, for good
or for ill, determined the main course of French poetry for
two whole centuries, and great part of that course for three.
In the second we have the similar work in prose, of Balzac by
counsel and example, by example of Descartes and Pascal;
the contest over the <cite>Cid</cite>, and the purblind but still intentionally
business-like investigations of Hédelin-d’Aubignac; the
constant debates of the Academy: and, perhaps most important
of all, the general <span lang="fr"><i>engouement</i></span> for literary discussion
of pedant and fine gentleman, of prude and coquette alike.
From the third come the ambitious code-making of Boileau;
the squabble, tedious and desultory, but in intention at least
wholly critical, of the Ancients and Moderns; the immense
collections of Baillet and others; the work, not bulky but
full of germ and promise, of Saint-Evremond, Madame de
Sévigné, Boileau, La Bruyère, Fénelon. What century earlier
(some may say, what century later) will give us, in any
country, a critical galaxy like this, where the stars dart,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>in at least most cases, so many other rays besides those of
criticism?</p>

<p class='c000'>It is possible—as the historian of such a subject as this
could wish that it were possible oftener—to do justice to
Malherbe’s undoubtedly prominent position in the
history of criticism without wasting much space on
him. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Malherbe.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The universally known phrase of Boileau,<a id='r294'></a><a href='#f294' class='c019'><sup>[294]</sup></a> though containing
an innuendo of the grossest critical injustice, and led
up to by a passage of astounding historical ignorance or falsification,
is yet substantially true. The stage of French poetry
which Malherbe started was a new stage; it was a stage not
at once, but before long, acquiesced and persevered in by all
but the whole population of the French Parnassus; and it
cannot be said that seventy years of almost unceasing effort
have done more than partially substitute a fresh one. Further,
it is undoubtedly in favour of Malherbe, though the compliment
may seem a left-handed one, that he was not a man of
commanding genius in any way; that he left no important
critical work; that his creative work is very scanty, far from
consummate as a rule, and by no means all in the style he
himself approved; and that even the secondhand accounts
which we have of his doctrines are scrappy, vague, and indirect.
For it is quite clear that a man who exercises such influence,
and exercises it practically at once, in such circumstances, must
have hit upon the right string, must have coincided strangely
with the general feeling, temper, aspirations, taste of his
countrymen. Our documents for these doctrines are an extensive,
but fragmentary, commentary on Desportes (the still
more destructive and characteristic handling of Ronsard seems
either to be a myth or never to have been preserved on paper),
the <cite>Life</cite> by Racan,<a id='r295'></a><a href='#f295' class='c019'><sup>[295]</sup></a> some phrases in the <cite>Letters</cite>, the vivid and
admirable attack of Regnier,<a id='r296'></a><a href='#f296' class='c019'><sup>[296]</sup></a> and the remarks of writers in his
own and the next generation.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>All concur in showing Malherbe to us as, on the one hand,
mainly a verbal critic, and on the other, as verbal critics
usually, but by no means always or necessarily are, singularly
unable to rise above the word, or its nearest neighbour, the
mere sense. Both these things made him the natural enemy
(though, for his earlier years at least, he was a more or less
disloyal follower) of the Pléiade. Their abundant word-coinages
and word-borrowings shocked him; he did not want, and could
not feel,<a id='r297'></a><a href='#f297' class='c019'><sup>[297]</sup></a> the poetic <span lang="fr"><i>souffle</i></span> which they managed to give by
means, or in despite, of their vocabulary. Racan, a rather
simple but absolutely honest creature, confesses that his master
<span lang="fr"><i>n’aimait du tout les Grecs</i></span>, regarded Pindar especially as a
maker of <span lang="la"><i>galimatias</i></span>, liked Statius and Seneca best of the
Latins,<a id='r298'></a><a href='#f298' class='c019'><sup>[298]</sup></a> and (it was generous) classed the Italians with the
Greeks. On the other hand, in French, he had at least the
merit of knowing exactly what he wanted, and exactly how to
get it. He it was who first invented those rigid laws of rhyme,
which even French classicism never quite adopted—the proscription
of the different use of <i>a</i> and <i>e</i> in such rhymes as <i>ance</i>
and <i>ence</i>, <i>ent</i> and <i>ant</i>; the rule against simples and compounds
of them, and even words which commonly go together, out of
verse, as <span lang="fr"><i>père</i></span> and <span lang="fr"><i>mère</i></span>. He was equally rigid on the cæsura:
and Racan is not to be suspected of catering for laughers,
though Tallemant might be, when he tells us that, while actually
in the death-struggle, Malherbe revived himself to tell his
nurse that she had used a word <span lang="fr"><i>qui n'ètoit pas bien Français</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is, however, in the Commentary on Desportes,<a id='r299'></a><a href='#f299' class='c019'><sup>[299]</sup></a> and there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>only, that we have the real Malherbe at first hand for our purpose.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Commentary on Desportes.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It is a very remarkable piece, and the first of the
kind in modern times;<a id='r300'></a><a href='#f300' class='c019'><sup>[300]</sup></a> though Gellius and Macrobius
no doubt set a certain pattern for it in
ancient. Nor am I acquainted with anything more thorough
in the particular species; the modern Zoilus, as a rule, is
equally inferior to Malherbe in thoroughness, acuteness, and
learning. More than 200 pages—a large page and a small type—are
occupied in M. Lalanne’s edition (the only one) with the
citations and remarks, the former being rigidly confined to the
line or two (rarely more) that Malherbe annotated. It would
be almost worth while to reprint<a id='r301'></a><a href='#f301' class='c019'><sup>[301]</sup></a> the original volume as it
exists scored by the critic’s hand, and I do not know that it
would be at all unfair to Desportes; for it is not the author
who comes worst out of the exposure.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whatever may be said against Malherbe, he cannot be accused
of verbiage. He constantly contents himself with a
single word—<span lang="fr"><i>bourre</i></span> (“padding”), <span lang="fr"><i>cheville</i></span> (“expletive”), or
simply <span lang="fr"><i>note</i></span> or <span lang="fr"><i>nota</i></span>, which expresses, much more forcibly, the
“Will the reader believe,” or “It will hardly be credited” of
our less succinct Aristarchs. It is curious how sensitive Malherbe’s
ear is to certain suggestions of real or fancied cacophony,
or absurdity, in juxtaposition of different words. There is no
doubt that the French habit of delivering verse in a sort of
recitative or singsong, running the syllables very much together,
putting strong emphasis on certain vowels and slurring
others, makes things like the famous “<span lang="fr">vaincu Loth</span>” and
“<span lang="fr">vingt culottes,</span>” “<span lang="fr">vieillard stupide</span>” and “<span lang="fr">vieil as de pique</span>”
less of mere childishness with them than with us. Malherbe
seems to have a perfect obsession of this kind, especially in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>the direction of alliterated syllables. Thus he annotates the
harmless line—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'><span lang="fr">“Si la foi plus certaine en une âme non feinte”—</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr"><i>n’en, nu, n’a</i></span>;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>and, still more in the style of the two later jokes—</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'><span lang="fr">“Mais vous, belle tyranne, aux Nérons comparable”—</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr"><i>Tira nos nez</i>!</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Indeed, he never loses an opportunity of blackmarking this
collocation of letters in different words, a point to which the
later Latin rhetoricians had perhaps made the French specially
attentive, but notice of which, except in the rarest cases, would
be thought unworthy of anybody but a schoolboy (or a comic
journalist of not the highest class) in England.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was perhaps a little dangerous for Malherbe to be so prodigal
of the words “pedantry” and “stupidity” as he is; while time
and use have sometimes made his peremptory judgments look
rather foolish. For instance, Desportes had used <span lang="fr"><i>poumons</i></span> in
the plural, as we have practically always used “lungs” in
English. “<span lang="fr">On ne dit,</span>” says our usher, with an almost audible
bang of the ferule on the desk,—<span lang="fr">“On ne dit point qu’un homme
ait des poumons: et ne m’allègue pas qu’il y a plusieurs lobes au
poumon, car tu serais un sot.”</span> Poor posterity! It has been (in
France) tolerably docile to Malherbe, but it has in this respect
undoubtedly written itself down an ass—or perhaps him. For
no Frenchman now would hesitate to use the word in the
plural. He is constantly objecting to <span lang="fr"><i>consommer</i></span> in the sense of
<span lang="fr"><i>consumer</i></span>; he ejaculates (with the sort of indignant bark which
we hear so often from him and from critics of his kind) on</p>

<p class='c022'>I should rather like to give more of this; but the reader will
no doubt say <span lang="la"><i>Sat prata</i></span>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>What can be said for his criticism.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> We must not be too hard on it. In
the first place, it is (as criticism of the Zoilus kind is
by no means always) transparently honest criticism.
Malherbe does not garble; he does not foist his own
misconception, not to say his own stupidity, on his author, and
then condemn him for it; he does not, like Boileau, fling offensive
and contemptuous epithets broadcast without anything to
support them. Further, there can be not the very slightest
doubt that such an office as his could, at the time, be very usefully
filled. The French sixteenth century, like our own, had
poured, and the early French seventeenth century had, also like
our own, begun to pour, a vast and rather indiscriminately
selected reinforcement of word and phrase and image into the
language. All this wanted sorting, arranging—in some cases,
though no doubt not in so many as Malherbe thought, rejecting
and clearing out. The mere French grammar, which Vaugelas
was soon to write, had not been written; and the Arts Poetic
in existence were, as we have already seen, either technical and
higgledy-piggledy, or like that of Vauquelin (which appeared
just as Malherbe was beginning his crusade, and of which it
would not be uninteresting to have a copy annotated by him as
he annotated Desportes), almost as higgledy-piggledy, and much
vaguer, on all technical points except some of the crotchets of
the Pléiade. Indeed, the best justification for Malherbe is the
French poetical history of the next thirty or forty years. He
may claim some, though but little, of the merit of such different
poets as Corneille and Voiture; the defects, where they really
existed, of Boileau’s victims can seldom or never be charged
upon him, and might sometimes have been avoided by listening
to his precepts.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>This, I think, is fairly generous as well as just; generosity
may now make her bow and leave justice unfettered; but
justice herself need not go beyond that admirable
pronouncement of Regnier, which has been already
referred to. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Its defects stigmatised at once by Regnier.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The great satirist, the passionate poet,
could hardly have needed a personal grievance to spur him on
to the composition of his Ninth Satire, though the generosity of
his character might have induced silence had not Malherbe
broken their friendship. The address to “<span lang="fr">Rapin<a id='r302'></a><a href='#f302' class='c019'><sup>[302]</sup></a> le favori
d’Apollon et des Muses</span>”<a id='r303'></a><a href='#f303' class='c019'><sup>[303]</sup></a> begins by graceful compliments, but
turns soon and sharply on</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in16'><span lang="fr">“Ces resveurs dont la Muse insolente</span></div>

      <div class='line'><span lang="fr">De reformer les vers.”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>If we have given Malherbe the credit of being the first
modern critic to play the awful Aristarch with a contemporary
in the true and full Aristarchian manner, Regnier
must deserve that of being the first poet of genius
in modern times to undertake a real <span lang="fr"><i>chevauchée</i></span> in the interests
of the true criticism against the false. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His</i> Ninth Satire.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The Satire is not
faultless; there is some divagation, and an attempt (giving
some countenance to the deplorable excesses, in the opposite
direction of insulting poverty, which Boileau and Pope permit
themselves) to set the profits and prosperity of Desportes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>against the comparative neediness of Malherbe. But this
neediness was only comparative; and Regnier has the good
taste never to name his adversary, and to let the arrows find
their mark without vulgar personal abuse. The spirit of the
piece is delightful; its straight hitting never baulks the game;
and the verse is often of the very first quality. Read—I only
wish I had room to quote—the passage, which only Juvenal and
Dryden have equalled, on Malherbe’s contempt alike of the
Greeks and the Pléiade (20-27); that on his elevation of the
mere vernacular, as the test of language, which follows; the
denunciation of his arrogant assumption of knowledge as being
his own peculiar, which follows that; and the famous diatribe
of forty verses long, and with every other verse a triumph,
which scoffs at the anxiety—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>

women, and contrasts the natural beauties of poetry with all
this powder and pomatum.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first hundred lines are the best part of the satire, and
the remainder is, to a certain extent, amplification and repetition.

and (no doubt to the writer half-unconsciously) many-sided<a id='r304'></a><a href='#f304' class='c019'><sup>[304]</sup></a>
lines. After two centuries Europe did “go to the fields”—and
she found something better to eat there than thistles.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the moment, as we have seen before in other cases, the
voice crying in the wilderness found only a wilderness to cry
in. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The contrast of the two a lasting one.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Men could not mistake the vigour and verve of Regnier’s
verse, but they either disregarded his doctrine or misunderstood
it. Malherbe was their music-maker then; they understood
<em>him</em>.<a id='r305'></a><a href='#f305' class='c019'><sup>[305]</sup></a> In the contrast of these two we have practically a contrast
which subsists to the present day, and which we do not
find by any means so sharply accentuated in ancient
criticism—that of the critic who looks only at the
stop-watch, and of the critic who looks beyond it;
of the critic of form and the critic of spirit. But the curious
thing is that for the last three centuries the antagonists have
behaved exactly like Hamlet and Laertes, or even like that
puzzling pair in the lower circles of the <cite>Inferno</cite>. They take
from time to time each other’s parts, each other’s weapons,
and renew the contest with changed persons, or at least
rapiers. At first sight it may seem as if Malherbe and, after
him, Boileau were simply insisting on form and expression;
as if Regnier, and those who at longer intervals have followed
him, were those who say that “all depends upon the subject.”
But a more accurate acquaintance with the History which is
to follow will show us that this is far from being the case.
Malherbe had so little opportunity of shaping, or took such
little trouble to shape, his critical ideas that it is perhaps the
safer way not to draw up any complete creed for him, as M.
Brunot and Mr Spingarn have done. But in Boileau, as we
shall see, there is a distinct attempt, which has been practically
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>followed by all of his side since, to prescribe expression, subject,
spirit, and everything—to insist not merely that the work shall
be good, but that it shall be good according to sealed patterns,
in choice of subject as well as in method, in method as well as
in form, in form as well as in language.</p>

<p class='c000'>There can be very little doubt that the private discussions
which, as we know from Racan, Malherbe used, for years before
his death, to hold with Racan himself and others, and
the letters which he also exchanged with younger
men, had a very great deal to do with the wide development
of criticism in the second third of the
century. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The diffusion of seventeenth century criticism.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The fact of this development is certain; it is vouched
for by the appearance of literary subjects in the <cite>Ana</cite>, and in
Tallemant’s <span lang="fr"><cite>Historiettes</cite></span>, by the foundation of the Academy, by
the <cite>Cid</cite> quarrel, practically by almost everything we know of
the time that concerns literature. But we must deal, according
to our wont, with the matter <span lang="fr"><i>par personnages</i></span>. Of such personages
we have, in the first place, Vaugelas, Balzac, Ogier, and
Chapelain, to whom we may join Ménage, Gui Patin, Tallemant
himself, and the far greater names of Saint-Evremond and
Corneille. Then we can take Boileau—at least in reputation
one of the culminating points or personages of our history—and
the less exclusively critical deliverances of La Bruyère, of
Fénelon, and of Malebranche; can give some account of the
Quarrel—tenacious of life, if scarcely vivacious—of the
Ancients and Moderns; diverge to the scholastic and somewhat
dismal but important performances of La Mesnardière
and others, of Hédelin and Le Bossu, Rapin and Bouhours, and
end by some account of the miscellaneous compilations and
observations of journalists and <span lang="fr"><i>savants</i></span>. The matter is abundant
in all conscience; it is at least sufficiently varied, and the real
greatness of some at least of the persons concerned should save
it from being insipid.</p>

<p class='c000'>We may all the better pass directly from Malherbe to
Vaugelas<a id='r306'></a><a href='#f306' class='c019'><sup>[306]</sup></a> because this is about the last place in this <cite>History</cite>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>where we can give special attention to <em>merely</em> verbal and grammatical
criticism. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Vaugelas.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In this Malherbe had at least
the absolute, and almost admirable, courage of his
opinions. On the one hand he transfers the prudery of the
Ciceronians (<i>v. supra</i>, p. 12) to French, and will not allow even
an analogue such as <span lang="fr"><i>accroît</i></span> on the strength of <span lang="fr"><i>surcroît</i></span>. On the
other he bars all the delightful Pléiade diminutives, likes not
technical terms, is so horrified at any indelicate suggestion
that his countrymen really need not have ridiculed our “sho[c]king,”
and has a whole black list of “plebeian” expressions.
Everything is to be “according to rule,” and the rule is to
be drawn with as few exceptions as possible—and with as few
inclusions.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is no wonder that Regnier opened the full broadside of
his magnificent poetical rhetoric against this system; and it
is only a pity that nobody less fantastic than Mlle. de Gournay—Montaigne’s
<span lang="fr"><i>fille d’alliance</i></span>, and almost the first as almost the
oddest of blue-stockings—took up the parable more practically
against it. But the set of the tide, as we have said, was with
him. La Mothe le Vayer, a little later, in his <span lang="fr"><cite>Considérations
sur l’Eloquence Française de ce temps</cite></span> “transacts,” though he is on
the whole on the side of liberty. And <span lang="fr"><cite>enfin Vaugelas vint</cite></span>, the
Savoyard<a id='r307'></a><a href='#f307' class='c019'><sup>[307]</sup></a> who was to teach France French. His famous
<span lang="fr"><cite>Remarques</cite></span> did not appear till 1647, when he was fifty-two, and
only three years before his death, but the book expresses work
much older.<a id='r308'></a><a href='#f308' class='c019'><sup>[308]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Vaugelas, to do him justice, has not the “pistolling ways” of
Malherbe. Usage is his standard, but, as in the old jest, the
coin is no sooner in the child’s pocket than he is told not to
spend it. It is <em>good</em> usage only that you must follow; and the
goodness of course is <span lang="la"><i>penes nos</i></span>. It would be neither interesting
nor proper here to discuss Vaugelas’ merely grammatical precepts,
but it is permissible to point out that he, first of all
moderns—or at any rate more than any early modern—contributed
to bring about the disastrous idea that grammar exists
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>independently, instead of being a generalisation, partly from the
usage which even great writers cannot violate, partly from their
own. But it is worth observing that, according to him, you
must not use technical words, popular words, improper words
(it is dreadful to say “breast,” for do we not talk of a “breast
of mutton or veal”?), poetical words in prose, archaisms,
neologisms, which last he hates more than anything else. And
when he comes to style, Purity, Clearness, Sobriety, and so
forth are of course his cardinal virtues.</p>

<p class='c000'>Jean Guez de Balzac, who, in the rather idle nomenclature
of traditional literary history, has usually been styled “the
Malherbe of French prose,” is on the whole more
important in the history of French style than in
that of French criticism. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Balzac.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He was not, as we have seen from
the phrase quoted above, by any means an indiscriminate
admirer of his correspondent—in fact, though not exactly a
Gascon,<a id='r309'></a><a href='#f309' class='c019'><sup>[309]</sup></a> he was enough of a Southerner to feel nettled at the
Northern arrogance which undertook <span lang="fr"><i>dégasconner la France</i></span>.
But he was himself an ardent disciple of “purity,” and the
principal objection that even posterity has made to his <span lang="fr"><cite>Socrate
Chrétien</cite></span>, his <span lang="fr"><cite>Aristippe</cite></span>, his <span lang="fr"><cite>Prince</cite></span>, and most of his elaborate
Letters, all of which were fanatically admired by contemporaries,
is that they are scarcely more than pieces of epideictic,
with very little substance in them.</p>

<p class='c000'>These same letters, moreover, contain numerous critical
passages; while a whole division of his <cite>Works</cite><a id='r310'></a><a href='#f310' class='c019'><sup>[310]</sup></a> is critical.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His Letters.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The interest, however, of the most literary part of
the <cite>Letters</cite>, those to Chapelain, as a whole, is not
so much on Balzac’s side as on Chapelain’s; and the subjects
of them will, at any rate in part, be best treated when we
come to discuss that (in the latter part of his own lifetime and
since) much-enduring writer. To Bois-Robert Balzac confides
(III. 7) that he only cares for verses as he does for melons—both
must be in absolute perfection if they are to please him;
also that the philosopher’s stone will be found as soon as the
sort of eloquence that <em>he</em> values. The thousand pages of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span><cite>Letters</cite> are sprinkled with finery of this sort; but better matter
is not very common. The somewhat hollow elegance which
the French allow to be the chief merit of Balzac does not lend
itself well to real criticism: nor, to do him justice, does he much
attempt this, even to men of letters like Conrart, Heinsius,
Descartes, or to Chapelain himself. Sometimes he drops
into verbal criticism, as in VI. 57, where he consents to call
Mlle. de Gournay herself <span lang="fr"><i>traductrice</i></span> and <span lang="fr"><i>rhétoricienne</i></span>, but not
<span lang="fr"><i>poétesse</i></span> or <span lang="fr"><i>philosophesse</i></span>. The letter to Scudéry in reference to
his attacks on <cite>The Cid</cite> is very sensible and in good taste; but
(as Balzac indeed generally is) much more ethical and “gentlemanly”
than æsthetic (XII. 20). Even when he writes directly
to Corneille (XVI. 9) about <cite>Cinna</cite> he cannot get much beyond
elegant generalities as to this Rome being the Rome <span lang="la"><i>de Tite
Live</i></span>. So that it is not surprising, when we come to the
Chapelain Letters themselves (of which, besides a few stray
ones earlier, there are six entire Books, XVII.-XXII.) that
although most of them touch literature, and many contain
critical remarks or judgments,<a id='r311'></a><a href='#f311' class='c019'><sup>[311]</sup></a> there is little of much interest.
Only now and then do we come across such a refreshment as:
“Why, sir, what prodigy do you tell me of? Is it possible
that any one with a drop of common-sense in him can prefer
the Spanish poets to the Italians? and take the visions of
a certain Lope de Vega for reasonable compositions?” (XX. 127).
His remarks on Ronsard and Malherbe, “the Martyr and the
Tyrant” (XXII. 20), are fair, and with room one might extend
the anthology. But on the whole, though Balzac was a very
handsome letter-writer, and could, and did, give all the Frank
Churchills of Europe lessons in that art, he was not very much
of a critic.</p>

<p class='c000'>His set Critical Dissertations quite confirm this verdict.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His Critical Dissertations.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He opens them with a great deal about Discipline,
<cite>Justesse</cite>, <cite>Bienséance</cite>, the Mean, and the like. He
tells us (vol. ii. p. 537) that any one who likes Ariosto
would prefer a Siren to a beautiful woman—the answer to which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>challenge may be justly suspended by the true critic till he has
a Siren produced before him. There might be much to be said
for her. He has some not unpleasant remarks on the obligatory
subject of the great sonnet-duel between Voiture’s “Uranie”
and Benserade’s “Job”: but he has not, so far as I remember,
discovered the critical truth that their beauty lies in the singular
charm of the <em>first</em> line of the one and the <em>last</em> of the other. He
is in one place (ii. 597) almost savage with Montaigne, of whom
he says that, though he be adopted father to Mlle. de Gournay,
esteemed by Father Paul, and <span lang="fr">“<i>allégué par le Chancelier Baccon</i>”</span>
(<i>sic</i>), he can see nothing in his Essays but equivoques and
mistakes of judgment. This, however, is said chiefly in reference
to Montaigne’s Latinity and knowledge of Latin: and elsewhere
(pp. 657-662) there is a set judgment much more favourable,
though still smacking of the double prejudice against a
prophet of his own country and a man of the last generation.
But his Dissertation on or against the Burlesque<a id='r312'></a><a href='#f312' class='c019'><sup>[312]</sup></a> style, when
one remembers the excesses in which, from Scarron down to
Dassoucy, men were about to indulge, is not contemptible: and
there are amusing things in his <span lang="fr"><cite>Barbon</cite></span>, a sort of elaborate
Theophrastian portrait of a young pedant, from which Scriblerus
may have borrowed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Vaugelas, as we have seen, did not finally elaborate his work
till some twenty years after Malherbe’s death,
and Balzac, though a correspondent of the Norman
poet, outlived him by more than a quarter of a
century. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Ogier and the Preface to</i> Tyr et Sidon.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But in the very year (1628) of that death
appeared a document on the other side, and taking that side
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>in flank at the point where it was, with the majority, to be most
victorious. This was the <cite>Preface</cite> of François Ogier to the
second edition of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Tyr et Sidon</cite></span> of Daniel d’Anchères, or
rather (for this is a mere anagram) Jean de Schélandre.<a id='r313'></a><a href='#f313' class='c019'><sup>[313]</sup></a> The
play is almost the only worthy representative, in French, of that
English-Spanish drama which set the Unities at defiance;<a id='r314'></a><a href='#f314' class='c019'><sup>[314]</sup></a> the
Preface, written twenty years after the first appearance of
the play, but seven before the author’s death, is a brief but
extraordinarily remarkable vindication, in principle, of Schélandre’s
practice. Until M. Asselineau, in 1854, published an
article on the subject, and the <span lang="fr"><cite>Bibliothèque Elzévirienne</cite></span>, two
years later, included both play and preface in the eighth volume
of the invaluable <span lang="fr"><cite>Ancien Théâtre Français</cite></span>, both were practically
unknown. Even then notice of them was for a long time confined
to literary historians; and of late an attempt has been
made to put the <cite>Preface</cite> aside as the mere freak of a student,
in opposition to the taste of the time and the necessities of the
stage. That the general course of literature in France followed
for a time the line which Ogier argued against, and to which
Schélandre ran counter, is perfectly true. But this is quite
indifferent (except as a matter to be registered) to history,
which knows perfectly well that Athanasius and his world are
always changing places and principles. Moreover, it is quite
a mistake to think that Ogier writes merely from the study,
and with no consideration of the stage. Like Cinthio, like
Patrizzi, like Castelvetro himself, he is no mere study-theorist.
On the contrary he carries the war into the enemy’s camp with
a refreshing audacity and no small force. It is the <em>classical</em>
arrangement, he says, which <span lang="fr"><i>offense le judicieux spectateur</i></span>, with
its improbable and unnatural coincidences and tallyings. How,
he asks, in a passage interesting to compare with Sidney’s satirical
description of the opposite style, do the identifying rings,
the shepherd-fosterers, the good old nurses, always turn up
<span lang="fr"><i>comme par art de magie</i></span> exactly at the right moment? How
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>is it that Creon, and the old attendant of Laius, and the Corinthian
who picked Œdipus up, all rendezvous at Athens in the
nick of time? Is verisimilitude observed even in the <cite>Agamemnon</cite>?
Is there anything dramatic at all—anything more than
sheer narration—in the <cite>Persæ</cite>? Can the extreme defenders of
the Unity of Time work out the <cite>Antigone</cite> on their lines? or
the <cite>Heautontimoroumenos</cite>? Then he proceeds to account (not
at all badly) for the practice of the ancients, and then to revert
to the only sound argument—that of Cinthio and Pigna in the
matter of the <span lang="it"><cite>Romanzi</cite></span>, of Il Lasca in reference to Italian
comedy—that Athens and Rome, and the lives and customs of
both, are <em>not</em> modern countries and their lives and customs,
that the practice of the one can give no final and prohibitive
rule to the practice of the other.<a id='r315'></a><a href='#f315' class='c019'><sup>[315]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>We are not in the least concerned to argue for this Preface.
It is enough to point out its bold and independent spirit, and
to lay special stress on the fact that Ogier fully admits that he
is defending, if not a heresy, an orthodoxy which is not popular,
offers to explain “<span lang="fr">pourquoi nous nous sommes jetez à quartier
du chemin ordinaire,</span>” speaks of the Unity of Time as “<span lang="fr">cette
règle que nos critiques veulent nous faire garder si religieusement
à cette heure,</span>” indirectly condemns the Unity of Place in
his arguments, and vindicates the full tragi-comic blending of
Actions. Now, this was in 1628, eight years before the <cite>Cid</cite> and
the <span lang="fr"><cite>Sentiments de l’Académie</cite></span>, even a year before Mairet’s <span lang="fr"><cite>Sophonisbe</cite></span>
earned the reputation of being the first French piece
that was absolutely “correct.” This is of itself enough to show
how erroneous is the idea, once common and still repeated, that
the discussion over the <cite>Cid</cite>, with Scudéry for mover, was in the
nature of a surprise, and that Chapelain, if he most certainly
did not invent the Unities, introduced them into France.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although M. Bourgoin, and one or two others, have done something
of late years to relieve Chapelain himself of the weight—not
so much of obloquy as of contemptuous ignoring—which rested
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>on him for nearly two centuries, even they have for the most
part lain under that curious fear of Boileau which we shall
have to notice so often. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Chapelain: the hopelessness of his verse.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Sainte-Beuve (who
knew his French seventeenth century as no other
man ever has known, or probably ever will know it,
and who had in his own possession the <em>MS.</em> Letters which do
Chapelain not a little credit) takes a kind of apologetic tone on
the subject, and seems never to have made up his mind to treat
Chapelain as a whole. It is, indeed, only on the prose side that
he can be approached without fear of disaster. There are good
things even in the <span lang="fr"><cite>Pucelle</cite></span>, but they are ill to win. You may
read Le Moyne, Desmarets, Saint-Amant, not without satisfaction
of the true poetic sort, especially in the first case. I think
I once got through some part of Scudéry’s <span lang="fr"><cite>Alaric</cite></span>. But the
<span lang="fr"><cite>Pucelle</cite></span> has a double touch-me-not-ishness—of <span lang="fr"><i>niaiserie</i></span>, and of
what Boileau (for once justly) calls “hardness”; there is something
really impregnable about her. And the minor pieces—fine
as is the Richelieu Ode in parts—hardly save their captainess.</p>

<p class='c000'>Chapelain as a critic is quite another person. He still writes
somewhat heavily: and (among his other faithfulnesses to the
Pléiade<a id='r316'></a><a href='#f316' class='c019'><sup>[316]</sup></a>) goes in the teeth of Malherbe and
Vaugelas by his use of classicised words. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The interest of his criticism.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But he
almost deserves the name of the first properly
equipped critic of France in point of knowledge: and (shocking
as the statement may appear) I am not sure that he was not
the last, till almost within the memory of an aged man. Not
only did he know Italian literature thoroughly—that was not in
his time uncommon for Frenchmen—and Spanish—that also
was not far to seek—but he was accurately drilled in the theory
and practice of Italian criticism. He is constantly referring to
it in his correspondence with Balzac; he (that is to say, the
transparently identical author of the main part at least of
the Censure of the <cite>Cid</cite>) not merely rests his objections on these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>critics, but refers to the controversies over the <cite>Gerusalemme</cite> and
the <cite>Pastor Fido</cite>, as he does elsewhere to that between Castelvetro
and Caro. Above all, he, almost alone of his time, knew
old French literature. It has not been noticed, I think, either
by M. Feillet, who published, or by M. Bourgoin, who discusses,
his most interesting and remarkable dialogue, <span lang="fr"><cite>Sur la Lecture
des Vieux Romans</cite></span>, that his devotion to <cite>Lancelot</cite> was almost
certainly one of his debts to Ronsard. For the Prince of Poets,
as we saw, expressly enjoined the reading of <cite>Lancelot</cite> and the
other romances in order to enrich the vocabulary.</p>

<p class='c000'>The blot on Chapelain’s critical record in the general estimation
is, of course, his<a id='r317'></a><a href='#f317' class='c019'><sup>[317]</sup></a> Censure of the <cite>Cid</cite> above referred to.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> <span lang="fr">Sentiments de l’Académie sur le Cid.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Even those who admit that critical like other
thought is free, and that a critic is not to be
sentenced to Malebolge because he is unfortunate
enough not to like the great work of a great man,
must acknowledge a certain striking poetical justice in the
spectacle of the censor of the <cite>Cid</cite>, for want of correctness, being
pitilessly flogged thirty years later by a correcter than he.
Nor, nowadays, do we admit much excuse in the undoubted
fact that this censure was practically forced on the Academy,
and on Chapelain, by the sordid jealousy of Richelieu.</p>

<p class='c000'>But even in this censure it is possible, even for one who
frankly puts Corneille at the head of all French Tragedy, to
acknowledge some critical merits. The first (not perhaps quite
the least) of these is that it is strictly <em>civil</em>; the second is that,
meticulous, purblind, peddling, prudish—a score of similar
epithets if you please—as it is, it does adopt an intelligible
code of critical judgment, and does apply that code with legal
propriety. Moreover, as we have seen, it is quite a mistake to
represent this code as being invented for the occasion—suddenly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>foisted upon France to gratify the envy of Scudéry and Mairet,
or the less excusable malignity of Richelieu. The code had been
growing for more than a century; it had been gaining wider
and wider acquiescence every day; the protests against it,
however gallantly made, had fallen practically unheard. Eight
years before we have Ogier explicitly admitting it as the code
of <span lang="fr"><i>nos critiques</i></span>—as the accepted opinion. We may be fully
entitled—some of us intend, for us and for our house, to do so,
whether entitled or not—to hold the Unities things vainly
invented in two cases, and mischievous, if exclusively and
universally enforced, in the third.<a id='r318'></a><a href='#f318' class='c019'><sup>[318]</sup></a> We may think the objections
to Corneille’s diction hypercritical, and the objection to
Chimène’s conduct utterly absurd.<a id='r319'></a><a href='#f319' class='c019'><sup>[319]</sup></a> But Chapelain, and those
about Chapelain, were also quite entitled to think differently,
and there is no reason to believe their opinion feigned, though
they might not have put it so forcibly save to curry favour with
the Cardinal. After all, Corneille hardly disputed their verdict
except in detail; and, whether luckily or unluckily, tried to do
as they told him afterwards.</p>

<p class='c000'>Chapelain’s other critical exercises are numerous: they are
quite interesting, and there ought to be some accessible collection
of them, for at present they have to be hunted
up in half-a-dozen different books or collections,
some of them very hard to get at. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Prefaces.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It is probable, though disputed,
that he wrote the Introduction to a translation of <span lang="fr"><cite>Guzman
d’Alfarache</cite></span>, which may have been done in his twentieth year,
and in which the author (according to the Pléiade view) by no
means magnifies his office as translator. He certainly wrote,
some years later, the prefatory panegyric to Marini’s <span lang="fr"><cite>Adone</cite></span>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>where he practises, in a fashion familiar to students of Italian
criticism, an elaborate scholastic division of kinds and qualities,
with definitions and connections of them.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Sur les Vieux Romans.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
We need not trouble
ourselves with his Academic discourse, against Love and for
Glory, which is full of <span lang="fr"><i>précieuse</i></span> personification, but pass to his
most interesting works, the <cite>Dialogue on the Romances</cite>
and the critical <cite>Letters</cite>. In the first<a id='r320'></a><a href='#f320' class='c019'><sup>[320]</sup></a> he maintains
the case of the Arthurian romances against Ménage
and Sarrasin, not with a thorough-going championship (that
would be wholly anachronistic), but with singular sense, knowledge,
and even, as far as it goes, appreciation. He does not
affect to admire the composition or the style in <cite>Lancelot</cite>. But
he knows something of the origin (it is extraordinary that he
allows it to be, in part at least, English). He will not allow
that, barring style and expression, there is any necessary gulf
between <cite>Lancelot</cite> and Homer (wherein he is a hundred years
ahead in sense of Blair, who was a hundred years ahead of him
in time), delights (taught to do so, as we said, by Ronsard) in
the vocabulary, and feels and rejoices in the point of honour
(“<span lang="fr">la crainte perpetuelle qu’ils ont de rien faire et de rien dire
dont leur reputation puisse souffrir la moindre tache</span>”),<a id='r321'></a><a href='#f321' class='c019'><sup>[321]</sup></a> their
jealousy of their word, their devotion (so different from “our
<span lang="fr"><i>galanterie</i></span>”) to their ladies. <span lang="la"><i>Quia multum amavit!</i></span> Moreover,
the document is connected in a rather fascinating manner with
another,<a id='r322'></a><a href='#f322' class='c019'><sup>[322]</sup></a> in which the same interlocutors, with others, appear,
which refers to it, and in which not only does Sarrasin confess
that he had been brought by Chapelain to a state of mind
different from that which is to be seen in his <span lang="fr"><cite>Discours</cite></span> noticed
below, but Chapelain himself reinforces his argument with a
long citation from, and discussion of, an episode in <span lang="fr"><cite>Perceforest</cite></span>—that
huge and interesting romance which is almost inaccessible
to modern readers, in consequence of the depraved persistence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>of modern scholars and Societies in reprinting the same text
in idle emulation of each other, instead of giving what are
practically <span lang="la"><i>anecdota</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Letters (published, with some omissions, by M. Tamizey
de la Roque in 1880, and supplemented fourteen years later by
some more in the Transactions of a learned Society<a id='r323'></a><a href='#f323' class='c019'><sup>[323]</sup></a>)
are crammed with references to books, and contain
not a little real criticism. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Letters, &#38;c.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> And lastly, the famous list<a id='r324'></a><a href='#f324' class='c019'><sup>[324]</sup></a> of
characterisations of French men of letters which Chapelain
drew up for Colbert’s use in allotting pensions, though it has
been laughed at in parts, is for its date (some of its subjects,
including Molière, had not yet done anything like their best
work) as sound, as sensible, and, at the same time, as benevolent
a hand-list of the kind as you shall discover in the records of
the centuries.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the whole we may say that Chapelain only wanted the proverbial
“That!” to make a good and perhaps a really great critic.
Not all, though a good deal, of the deficiency must be put down
to the transition character of time, taste, literary diction, and
everything, in midst of which he found himself. The point of
critical genius, the ability to grasp and focus and methodise,
must have been wanting too. But he had knowledge, both of
literature and of criticism; he had obviously catholic, if not
unerring, sympathies; he had acuteness and penetration, if not
quite combination and the architectonic; and he was entirely
free from that ill-nature which, while it may seem to assist the
critic, really disables him. <span lang="fr"><i>Critique manqué</i></span>, perhaps, on the
whole; but still on his day a critic and no mean one.</p>

<p class='c000'><span lang="fr">“Il faut observer l’Unité d’action, de lieu et de jour. Personne
n’en doute.”</span> But, out of France at least, and perhaps in it, it
is possible that few people may know, or even
doubt, whence this saying comes. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Corneille.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It would be an
insult to a Frenchman of letters to tell him that it comes from
Pierre Corneille; long, it is true, after the debate over the <cite>Cid</cite>,
but nearly a quarter of a century before the close of his glorious,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>if not too happy, life. It may be gathered—rather from a long
and large induction than from any single utterance of a person
of importance—that the French do not think very much of
Corneille as a critic; it may be further gathered from this that
a man should never submit his genius. <span lang="la"><i>Tu contra audentior ito</i></span>
is the counsel of wisdom. He has written much the best things
that have been written in favour of the “correct” theory; but
its partisans (and small blame to them) suspect him. They see
the eyes of Chimène behind the mask, and they distrust them—wisely
also after their kind.</p>

<p class='c000'>But we must not rhapsodise here on the admirable poetry of
this great poet, and the way in which the critics not merely, as
somebody said in his own day, <span lang="fr"><i>ont tari sa veine</i></span>, but made him
in a way false to it. We have only to do with his actual
criticism; and whatever view we take of the general question,
it must be here pronounced great criticism of its kind. The
three <span lang="fr"><cite>Discours</cite></span>, and the series of <span lang="fr"><cite>Examens</cite></span> which appeared first
in 1660, present an almost unique, an extremely touching, and
(to men of English birth) a rather incomprehensible instance
of a man of supreme genius crouching and curbing himself to
obey the tendency of the time and the dictates of “the wits.”<a id='r325'></a><a href='#f325' class='c019'><sup>[325]</sup></a>
<em>We</em> are not kneaded of this dough. We cannot even conceive
Shakespeare taking a copy of Sidney or going to Ben, and afterwards
constructing dramas as regularly as he could, or apologising
for their irregularity; Milton adjusting <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> to
Dryden’s views of rhyme; nay, even Dryden himself (who is
in some ways, as we shall see, very close to Corneille) “looking
first at the stop-watch” in any way. But “things are as they
are,” and (a great saying from which sometimes the wrong
inference has been drawn) “their consequences will be what
they will be.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The three Discourses, <span lang="fr">“De l’Utilité et des parties du Poëme
Dramatique,”</span> <span lang="fr">“De la Tragédie,”</span> and <span lang="fr">“Des Trois Unités,”</span> and the
<span lang="fr"><cite>Examens</cite></span> of the different plays, are the result of this submission.<a id='r326'></a><a href='#f326' class='c019'><sup>[326]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Three</i> Discourses.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Let us say at once that it is in no sense the mere submission
of a man who recants, either with tongue in cheek
or simply under fear of rack and gallows and fire.
Corneille (and this is the interesting point of the French
temperament as contrasted with the English) is really affected
by authority, and by the <span lang="de"><i>Zeitgeist</i></span>. He has been honestly converted;
indeed he asserts (and we may believe him to a great
extent) that he never needed conversion—it was only
his green unknowing age that made him go wrong. In
the three Discourses he examines the question with plentiful
quotations from Aristotle, with some knowledge of Italians like
Castelvetro and Beni and Pazzi (Pacius) as well as of Heinsius.
He is quite aware of the weak points of the ancients;
he repeats, though he does not much dwell upon, the earlier
comments on the singular rapidity with which Agamemnon<a id='r327'></a><a href='#f327' class='c019'><sup>[327]</sup></a>
follows the beacon-fires, the astonishing patness of the turning
up of the Corinthian in the <cite>Œdipus</cite>. And to any one who
thinks little of Corneille as a critic I should like to prescribe
the reading, marking, and inwardly digesting of his remarks in
the <span lang="fr"><i>Discours des Trois Unités</i></span> on the separation of acts and scenes,
and the relation of the chorus to orchestral interludes. Elsewhere
we may find the mark of the chain: as where the poet,
pretending indifference, is evidently rather unhappy because he
cannot tell exactly what the wicked Queen in <span lang="fr"><i>Rodogune</i></span> (which
some have thought his best play next to the <cite>Cid</cite>) was doing
when she was not on the stage. This inquiry is of itself almost
sufficient to show the sheer idiocy to which this kind of criticism
is always on the point of descending. But on the whole, and
since Giant Unity has long ceased even to gnash at the pilgrims,
we can tolerate it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <span lang="fr"><cite>Examens</cite></span> are of still greater importance; for we have
had plenty of inquiries in general into the qualities
and requirements of Kinds, though few from persons
like Corneille. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Examens.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The system of elaborate critical reviews—for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>that is what it comes to—of his past work, by a great poet
who has taken pains to acquaint himself with critical method,
and is almost too respectful of its utterances, is practically a
new one. There is a certain flavour of it in Spenser and Ronsard,
much more than a flavour in Tasso; but it was not till the
seventeenth century, when the critic was abroad in earnest, that
it could be done on such a scale as this. For Corneille, though
he never issued any <span lang="fr"><cite>Examens</cite></span> till 1660, applied them to all but
his very latest plays. To the mere general reader they may be
rendered distasteful by the elaborate and most pathetic pains
which Corneille takes to adjust himself to the theories which
his reason docilely accepted, but to which his faith was always
secretly recalcitrant. To the student of him, and to the student
of criticism, they must always have a great attraction.</p>

<p class='c000'>But for the latter, if he have but a little of the “rascally
comparative” spirit, they have an attraction greater still. There
is no doubt at all that they served as pattern, at a very brief
interval, to the critical exercises of Dryden, and thereby opened
a way which criticism is treading still. And there is more in
them besides this accidental and extrinsic attraction. Corneille,
though he really shows extraordinary impartiality as well as
great acumen in his examinations, was by the mere force of
nature driven to stick close to his actual work, to observe it
narrowly, if only so as to put the best face on it. And, as we
have seen, the great fault both of ancient and of mediæval
criticism was the omission or the refusal to consider individual
works of art minutely and exactly—the constant breaking off
and escape to the type. The natural partiality of authors for
their own work has not always been fortunate in its results.
Here it was so.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although we have had, and shall have, to question the exact
importance assigned by some to the <cite>Cid</cite> quarrel, there can be
no doubt that it had a very important influence,
extending far beyond the chief parties concerned,
and helping, very particularly, that popularisation of
criticism which is undoubtedly the work of France
in general, and of the French Academy in particular. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>La Mesnardière—Sarrasin—Scudéry.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In the
years almost immediately succeeding it we have, for 1639, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span><span lang="fr"><cite>Discours de la Tragédie</cite></span> of the ingenious and ill-fated Sarrasin,
for 1640 the formal <span lang="fr"><cite>Art Poétique</cite></span> of La Mesnardière, a treatise
specially dealing with tragedy, strongly, almost idolatrously,
Aristotelian in tone, and characterised by a lively polemic
against the Spanish and Italian influences which had been so
powerful for a generation in France. Scudéry followed up the
pamphlets which had actually given occasion to the <cite>Cid</cite> dispute,
almost at the same period, with the Preface to <cite>Ibrahim</cite>,
as well as years afterwards in that to <cite>Alaric</cite>. Nay, it was at
this very time (about 1640) that the world was at least
threatened with the birth of the dullest critical treatise of the
century, that of Hédelin, though a respite of seventeen years
was actually granted.</p>

<p class='c000'>La Mesnardière had evidently made a careful study of the
Italian critics. His very <em>format</em>—a handsome small quarto—reminds
one of their favourite shape, and contrasts curiously
with the tiny duodecimos of the sixteenth-century French
critics. And he puts forth his whole strength in arguing for
the Stagirite against the blasphemies of Castelvetro, whom,
however, he declares that he honours <span lang="fr"><i>hors des intérêts d’Aristote</i></span>—an
odd, but very characteristic, way of putting it. La
Mesnardière, who follows out all the Aristotelian divisions,
even to Music (with engraved airs), is equally odd and equally
representative in identifying, or at least associating in his first
Chapter, <span lang="fr"><i>Politesse</i></span> with “Imagination.” Mere Understanding
will make a Philosopher—the Poet must be polished up into
an Imaginative condition. He does not neglect language and
diction: and though he devotes himself to drama, illustrates
copiously from non-dramatic poetry, and criticises his illustrations
in the way which was becoming so common and is so
important. But a specimen passage in a footnote<a id='r328'></a><a href='#f328' class='c019'><sup>[328]</sup></a> will explain,
better than pages of discussion, the fatally parasitic character
of most of his criticism.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sarrasin and Scudéry documents are complementary as
well as complimentary of this and of each other. For Sarrasin’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span><span lang="fr"><cite>Discours</cite></span><a id='r329'></a><a href='#f329' class='c019'><sup>[329]</sup></a> is devoted to Scudéry’s <span lang="fr"><cite>Amour Tyrannique</cite></span>, which is so
perfect that Aristotle would have put it in the <cite>Poetics</cite>, instead
of or beside the <cite>Œdipus</cite>, if he had only known it. And La
Mesnardière is just going (see dates given) to write “divinely”
on that art of poetry which those great men, Ronsard and Du
Bellay, did not know, and therefore recommended the study
of Romances.<a id='r330'></a><a href='#f330' class='c019'><sup>[330]</sup></a> Finally, “Armand” [Richelieu, of course] is <span lang="fr"><i>le
Dieu tutélaire des lettres</i></span>. As for the great Georges de Scudéry
himself, his Prefaces to <cite>Ibrahim</cite> and <cite>Alaric</cite> are quite worthy
of the “Commander of the Fort of Notre Dame de La Garde
and Kept-Captain to the King,” whose portrait guards the
entrance of the stately folio of <cite>Alaric</cite>. That is to say, they
are an odd mixture of bombast (he leads off that to this book
with a list of critics and poets, all of whom he has read),
crotchet, and real wits. Both are worth comparing with
Davenant’s to <cite>Gondibert</cite> (<i>v. infra</i>, p. 367), which came between
them.<a id='r331'></a><a href='#f331' class='c019'><sup>[331]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Some years later the uncompromising Aristotelianism of La
Mesnardière as to the Drama was continued and straitened
yet further, in reference to the Epic, by Pierre
Mambrun,<a id='r332'></a><a href='#f332' class='c019'><sup>[332]</sup></a> who was, like so many others of these
French seventeenth-century critics, a Jesuit. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Mambrun.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> His principles
(which he illustrated later by a <span lang="la"><cite>Constantinus sive De Idolatria
debellata</cite></span>) exhibit the French detestation of compromise in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>most agreeable light: whether his practice does not also
illustrate the non-epic character of the French head is another
matter. Aristotle, and the whole Aristotle, so far as the
<cite>Poetics</cite> go, is Mambrun’s motto; if he cannot add “nothing but
Aristotle,” that is merely because his text is admittedly meagre
as to Epic. But he does what he can. He has read Scaliger
and Voss, and has a proper respect for them as learned men,
but he is shocked at both for their worshipping of idols—at
Scaliger for wasting time on diction and metre, as well as for
falling foul of Homer, at Voss for making the persons instead
of the action the centre of Epic. On the other hand, the too
famous Petronian passage is to him a kind of inspired postscript
to the <cite>Poetics</cite>. In his handling of Poetry, which for
him is first of all Epic Poetry, he is scholastic as to the frame.
The Material cause is Action; the Formal cause the Fable;
the Efficient cause a combination of Prudentia and Furor
Poeticus; the Final Cause <em>not</em> pleasure but the making of
statesmen. In all these respects Homer and Virgil are perfect—Statius,
Lucan, Ariosto, Tasso, sinners. The former always
observe the Unity, the Integrity, the Magnitude of the Action.
Mambrun has satisfied himself that the Action of the <cite>Odyssey</cite>
only includes fifty-five days—on which principle one would
cheerfully undertake to write an <cite>Arthuriad</cite>, to include the
whole of Malory and more, on an “action” of the time
between Agravaine’s detection of Lancelot with the Queen and
the last fight in Lyonnesse. He thinks that a woman may be
a heroine of tragedy but cannot be of Epic (which seems
unkind to Chapelain). He admits that to distinguish between
the Action and the Fable is not easy; that even in Aristotle
the two are sometimes identical. But properly the Fable is
<span lang="la"><i>actio culta et ornata</i></span>, and he has an ingenious receipt for stripping
the matter of episodes and names. Epic is not Art, not
Logic, not History; it is “Prudentia.” But <span lang="la"><cite>Furor Poeticus</cite></span>?
Mambrun’s section of <span lang="la"><cite>Furor Poeticus</cite></span> is by far the most interesting
in his book. He distinguishes first the Kinds of
Fury. Then he points out that the Epic Poet must not be
furious in constituting his fable. Very much the reverse.
“But in episodes and descriptions and speeches I shall not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>deny that a little fury may be sprinkled in”<a id='r333'></a><a href='#f333' class='c019'><sup>[333]</sup></a>—the fury-dredger,
or poetic cruet, being thus authoritatively established as an
implement of the Bard. Nor does he conceal the process.
The poet thinks very hard about an episode, a description, &#38;c.
Then the black bile warms itself, flies up, inflames the brain,
and the poet is poetically furious. But in another memorable
passage, “being strong in black bile will not necessarily make
you a poet.”<a id='r334'></a><a href='#f334' class='c019'><sup>[334]</sup></a> [Alas! it will not.] There must be discipline,
&#38;c. In short, the book is a precious one.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are few critics—not such by profession, and not precisely
of the very highest rank—who, from the very first, and
with an unbroken record, have enjoyed such a reputation
as has been constantly maintained by Saint-Evremond.<a id='r335'></a><a href='#f335' class='c019'><sup>[335]</sup></a>
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Saint-Evremond.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Nor is there, perhaps, a single one who has better
deserved this constancy on the part of the great inconstants,
Time and Fortune. He was commended to his own time
scarcely more by birth and station as a fine gentleman and
soldier, or by his singular political and personal history, than
by the admirable quality of his writing; to the eighteenth
century by his touches of scepticism and libertinage; to the
Romantic revival by his championship of Corneille against
Racine, and by the <span lang="fr"><i>frondeur</i></span> spirit which made him resist the
tyranny of the classical creed. But it is also true that he has
purely critical qualities of a very uncommon kind. It is perhaps
a testimony to that spice of universal in him which has
been noticed, that the particular stamp to be put on these
qualities—the particular class to which Saint-Evremond is to
be referred—is not quite matter of agreement among those
who fully agree as to his general merits. To M. Bourgoin, for
instance, his critical spirit seems to be nearer to that of Boileau
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>and the critics of rule than to that of Fénelon, or even La
Bruyère, and the critics of impression and <span lang="fr"><i>sens propre</i></span>. To me
the approximation seems to be in the other direction.</p>

<p class='c000'>The acute and learned author of <span lang="fr"><cite>Les Maîtres de la Critique</cite></span>
has, I think, been a little deceived by superficial characteristics
of form and method. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His critical quality and accomplishment.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> A young man of twenty at the date of
the <cite>Cid</cite>, and the battle over it, Saint-Evremond, fine
gentleman as he was, no more forgot the forms of the
quarrel than the attractions of the play. He has
something a little scholastic, something of the earlier
century, in his manner. Perhaps the best piece of criticism
which he has left us—the <span lang="fr"><cite>Dissertation sur le mot “vaste”</cite></span>—recalls
the known or alleged subjects of the earlier conversations
of Malherbe and Racan, and their fellows, the later of
Vaugelas and Chapelain and the young Academy. We have
a formal <span lang="fr"><cite>Jugement sur Senèque, Plutarque, et Pétrone</cite></span>, a quite
academic study of <span lang="fr"><cite>Alexandre le Grand</cite></span>, discussions of the character
of tragedy generally, and the like. But the accomplished,
agile, and independent spirit of the author is perpetually escaping
from the restraints of his forms and models, and taking its
own way according to its own taste. Perhaps, indeed, the fatal
equivocation or ambiguity which seems to beset so many critical
terms has worked here also: for to the present day the word
“<span lang="fr">Taste</span>” seems to excite quite dissimilar ideas in different
minds. To some (as to Boileau and his followers it certainly
did) it seems to suggest an antecedent law, a bar to which subjects
are to be brought, something to which it is almost improper
to apply the terms “good” or “bad,” because there is
only one taste, and anything else is not taste at all but <em>un</em>taste.
In this sense, though he might not have allowed it, I do not
think that Saint-Evremond ever judged by “taste.” In the
other—where taste means the approbation and satisfaction of a
competent judge, well-gifted, well-tried, and taking pains to
keep his palate clean—I think he always judged by it. That
he often gave reasons for his judgment is nothing; one should
<em>almost</em> always do that. But one should always also remember
that these reasons may be totally inapplicable to the next
instance.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>Saint-Evremond, we have said, was a great admirer of Corneille,
and a steady champion of him against Racine. His
admiration has been set down to the mere “fallacy
of first love,” as we may call it—the fact that the
youth of the poet and the youth of the critic had coincided.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His views on Corneille.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> This is not fair. Inviolable constancy to first loves is not
precisely the chief thing in an Epicurean temperament. Saint-Evremond,
in his various utterances on the subject, makes it
perfectly clear <em>why</em> he preferred the older to the younger poet;
and Cornelians and Racinians alike must agree that, whether
his conclusions were right or wrong, his considerations were at
any rate genuine and adequate. The variety and vigour of the
one as opposed to the somewhat monotonous mould and soft
(or, as some said, “creeping”) sentiment of the other, form a
real difference: and so throughout.</p>

<p class='c000'>On what was then a burning subject—one which cannot be
said to have been quite put out, though its ashes only smoulder—the
suitableness of religious and especially Christian
subjects for epic and drama, &#38;c., Saint-Evremond’s
opinion is a little tainted by his undoubted “philosophy,”
to use the word which had already become fashionable for the
various shades of unbelief. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>On Christian subjects, &#38;c.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  But either from this cause, or from
a general critical spirit, he escapes the inconsistency (in which
Boileau for instance is entangled) of contending that the
<span lang="la"><i>deorum ministeria</i></span> are capital things in ancient, and very bad
things in modern, poetry. His remarks on the theory of Purgation
are a little irreverent but by no means irrational; and
he makes strong play for the contention (of which, if he did
not invent it, he was one of the strongest and most original
champions) that “Admiration is a tragic passion” worthy of
being seated beside Pity and Terror, and necessary to be kept
in sight even when we deal with Love.</p>

<p class='c000'>In respect of the Ancient and Modern dispute—of all three
stages of which, <i>v. infra</i>, his long life made him a contemporary,
while he actually took a sort of skirmishing
part in the two earlier—his position is distinctly
that of a true critic. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>On Ancients and Moderns.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> From what has been said
already it will be clear that he could not be an out-and-out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>Ancient; but he is as little a Modern of the Perrault type.
One sees that the Moderns gave him most pleasure, and in the
Ancients whom he really likes, such as Petronius (supposing no
merely unworthy motives to have entered into the preference),
it is easy to discern the modern element. But in neither case
does he “like grossly” and in the lump; he has his reasons and
his affinities, and can state both easily. He is even not very
far from that “horizontal” view of literature, without deceptive
foreshortenings and distances, which is, up to his time,
so rare. Nothing is more striking than his remarks on English
literature—at least the English drama. Perhaps he did
not himself know much English; and something of the kind
seems to be insinuated in Dryden’s remarks<a id='r336'></a><a href='#f336' class='c019'><sup>[336]</sup></a> on the matter,
though Dryden was naturally hurt at the selection of Shadwell
for commendation. But if so he apprehended what Waller and
others said to him about Ben Jonson’s comedy with almost
miraculous divination, and reflects in his account of our tragedy
rather less than the current mistakes on the subject among
Englishmen of the Restoration period themselves. And here
also, as in his remarks on Spanish and Italian, is noticeable
this same horizontal and comparative spirit.</p>

<p class='c000'>On his treatment of Opera I may be permitted to repeat
what I wrote more than twenty years ago, that it really contains
the substance of everything that has been said since on
the literary side of the matter. As for the “Vaste” dissertation
the best thing to say is <span lang="la"><i>Tolle, lege</i></span>. I do not think it
possible to have a better example of that rarest of things,
literary philology, in the true and not the distorted sense of the
substantive. The Academy opined—in fact had opined already
(whence much of the salt of the piece)—against Saint-Evremond.
But his Dissertation is, like all his criticism more
or less, a really extraordinary example of the combination of all
that was best in the French academic spirit with freedom from
most of its faults. This union of freedom and delicacy, of
precision and independent play, is Saint-Evremond’s glory as
a critic, and it distinguishes him, not merely from Boileau, but
from most others between 1660 and 1800. Addison had (and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>no doubt directly borrowed) something of the same touch;
Fénelon, in a different spirit, had a great deal: we shall find
something of it in Gravina. But it is very rare in the period,
and it is precisely the absence of it as a “compensation balance”
which vitiates neo-classic criticism as a whole.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is common, if not universal, to glance at the redoubtable
and satiric doctor, Gui Patin, as at least an outlier among
French seventeenth-century critics; but the reader
who, as Matthew Arnold says, “wants criticism”
will not find much of it in his very amusing
<cite>Letters</cite>.<a id='r337'></a><a href='#f337' class='c019'><sup>[337]</sup></a> <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Gui Patin—his judgment of Browne.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> An <em>English</em> reader may be specially disappointed
because he is most likely to know the surprising, the repeated,
the, to all appearance, fully genuine, and the very felicitous
remarks<a id='r338'></a><a href='#f338' class='c019'><sup>[338]</sup></a> of Patin on the <span lang="la"><cite>Religio Medici</cite></span>. A Frenchman who
can appreciate Browne, who can see in the <span lang="la"><cite>Religio</cite></span> a book not
merely <span lang="fr"><i>tout gentil et curieux</i></span> but <span lang="fr"><i>fort délicat et tout mystique</i></span>,
who can perceive its <span lang="fr"><i>étranges et ravissantes pensées</i></span>, who can
pronounce <span lang="fr"><i>il n’y a guère encore de livre de la sorte</i></span> (alas! we
may drop the <span lang="fr"><i>guère</i></span> and continue the <span lang="fr"><i>encore</i></span>), who can describe
the author as a <span lang="fr"><i>mélancolique agréable en ses pensées</i></span>, who can say
of his stupid commentators <span lang="fr"><i>ce livre n’a pas besoin de tels écoliers</i></span>,
and even desire ardently to be acquainted with Sir Kenelm
Digby’s reply—may seem to have handed in his credentials
as a critic once and for all. But one soon finds that Patin’s
interest in Browne was, first of all, <span lang="fr"><i>esprit de corps</i></span> (which was
perhaps stronger in the Faculty of that time than in any profession
of any other), and secondly, a certain coincidence of
true but unconventional piety, different as were its forms in
the two. Elsewhere Patin is a collector, an eager student of
new books, a scholar even, with a conviction that Scaliger and
Casaubon were “the two first men of their time,” and that
Salmasius was a “<span lang="fr">grand héros des belles lettres</span>”; but not a
critic, and with a distinctly limited idea of <span lang="fr"><i>belles lettres</i></span> themselves.
He speaks contemptuously of Descartes, he barely
mentions Corneille. He was, in fact, generally too angry with
antimony, opium, quinine, the English, and Mazarin, or else too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>much rapt in ecstasy at the divine powers of bleeding and
purging,<a id='r339'></a><a href='#f339' class='c019'><sup>[339]</sup></a> to have time to think of poetry, or even of prose.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor can we afford much space to the main body of the
Academicians, of the frequenters of “the” Hotel (<span lang="fr"><i>par excellence</i></span>),
of the abbés, and <span lang="fr"><i>marquis</i></span>, and even <span lang="fr"><i>marquises</i></span>
who crowd the middle of the seventeenth-century
history of France, not disagreeably for posterity.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Tallemant, Pellisson, Ménage, Madame de Sévigné.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> They must be sought in Tallemant (himself, as
citations will have shown, interested in the matter, and not
inept at it) as a main and single preserver, in a hundred other
places, original and second-hand, from the contemporary records
to the essays of Sainte-Beuve and his followers. We could fill
this volume with them without the slightest difficulty; but, as
in all true history, they must “speak by their foremen,” and
even these foremen cannot have much place. The modest and
amiable Pellisson, the historian of the Academy, whose personal
ugliness Boileau had the insolent vulgarity to satirise,<a id='r340'></a><a href='#f340' class='c019'><sup>[340]</sup></a> but who
had a “soul of gold,” was by no means a bad though a too
amiable critic, and had the sense and courage not to deny
Ronsard when the fashion turned against him, just as he
clove to Fouquet when it was positively, and even extremely,
dangerous to do so. Ménage, to whom his own unguardedness
and the satire of Molière<a id='r341'></a><a href='#f341' class='c019'><sup>[341]</sup></a> have given something of a ridiculous
position in literary history, had the wit to see the merit
of Molière himself quite early, possessed very wide reading,
and could make judicious reflections on it, had studied the
Italian critics,<a id='r342'></a><a href='#f342' class='c019'><sup>[342]</sup></a> and could now and then (as in the brief
obituary notice of Scarron<a id='r343'></a><a href='#f343' class='c019'><sup>[343]</sup></a>) hit off his stroke extremely well.
As for Marie de Sévigné, adorable to all, and especially adored
by these two, she is generally right, and always illustrates the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>saying of La Bruyère, which is quoted below, whether she is
right or not. But her critical position is so close to that of
Saint-Evremond that what we have said of him is almost
equally applicable to her, though she invests the critical
attitude with her own peculiar charm.</p>

<p class='c000'>With one remarkable exception as almost a whole, and a
certain number of scattered passages in some of them,<a id='r344'></a><a href='#f344' class='c019'><sup>[344]</sup></a> the
most noteworthy thing in the other <cite>Ana</cite>, which
has relation to Criticism, is the almost invariable
connotation of the word in them. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Ana <i>other than Ménage’s, especially</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Vigneul-Marville,<a id='r345'></a><a href='#f345' class='c019'><sup>[345]</sup></a>
noticing a book, says that there are in it
<span lang="fr"><i>deux remarques de critique</i></span>, one that Myconos is not so far from
Delos as Ferrari says, being only two leagues instead of seven,
and the other, that somebody else is wrong in saying that it
belongs to the Venetians since it is in the power of the Turks.
Of course in a sense these are “critical” observations; but one
is a little reminded of Hegel and philosophical instruments.
More unmistakable is the clear definition given by the author
of the book above excepted. Huet (p. 232 <i>ed. cit.</i>) says explicitly
that <cite>Critique</cite> is “that part of grammar which busies
itself with re-establishing the text of ancient authors in its first
integrity, and purging out changes due to ignorance,” &#38;c. <em>This</em>,
he goes on to say, is the art which Aristotle is said to have
invented; and yet, further, he frankly declares that he himself
has always looked on it as “a mean business.”<a id='r346'></a><a href='#f346' class='c019'><sup>[346]</sup></a> Yet, not
merely in the well-known <span lang="fr"><cite>De l’Origine des Romans</cite></span>, which is not
unfrequently found in connection with the <cite>Huetiana</cite>, but in
these themselves, he shows that he had no mean conception
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>of the higher and nobler branches of the Art. His remarks
on the Quarrel<a id='r347'></a><a href='#f347' class='c019'><sup>[347]</sup></a> are among the most sensible that we have,
as was to be expected from a man who was at once an
excellent scholar in ancient, and a warm admirer of modern,
literature. If he is less wise on rhyme,<a id='r348'></a><a href='#f348' class='c019'><sup>[348]</sup></a> let us remember that
this is <span lang="la"><i>parcius objiciendum</i></span> to a contemporary, although a younger
contemporary, of Milton; and if he is responsible for the
astonishing statement<a id='r349'></a><a href='#f349' class='c019'><sup>[349]</sup></a> that Greek poetry “<span lang="fr">a toujours décliné
depuis Homère,</span>” let us simply decline the attempt to construct
any critical theodolite which will show us this line of constant
declension through Sappho and Pindar, Æschylus and Aristophanes,
Theocritus and the best of the Anthologists. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>the</i> Huetiana.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
On the
other hand, the assertion advanced in the <span lang="fr"><cite>Origine des Romans</cite></span>,
and defended in the <cite>Ana</cite>, to the effect that a good
judge of poetry is even rarer than a good poet, is too
double-edged, in its apparent flattery of our own office, for us to
make any difficulty in applauding it, while the defence itself is
singularly good. The everlasting comparison of Virgil to Theocritus
and Homer has seldom been better handled than by Huet.
Indeed the whole book is worth reading for the critical passages
it contains. The <span lang="fr"><cite>Traité des Romans</cite></span> is a little discursively and
promiscuously erudite, and Huet is thinking too much of the
bastard romance of his own time, too little of the true-bred
romances of old: but he knows something even of these, and he
is well acquainted with the attempts of Cinthio and Pigna in
the previous century to make good at least the Italian form of
the kind.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Valesiana,</div>

<p class='c000'>In the <cite>Valesiana</cite>—amid much that is merely antiquarian or
linguistic, and a fair though not excessive portion of the mere
gossip and gabble which first made these things read
and afterwards brought them into disrepute—there
will be found a curious passage on the Latin hymns and their
prosody, showing how dead the ear falls at certain times to the
music of others, and the more curious selection of Palingenius
and his <span lang="la"><cite>Zodiacus Vitæ</cite></span> as a poem and a poet worth the pains of
reading. Nor will the reputation for robustness of seventeenth-century
erudition suffer from the patronising commendation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>Baillet’s <span lang="fr"><cite>Jugements des Savants</cite></span> as a book which would be useful
light reading for the giddy youth of the day who declined serious
study. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Scaligerana,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Yet Scaliger himself (J. J., not J. C.), according
to the collection<a id='r350'></a><a href='#f350' class='c019'><sup>[350]</sup></a> standing in his name (a quaint
mosaic or macaronic of French and Latin), thought that nobody
save Casaubon (and “another that shall be nameless,” no doubt)
was really learned as men had been a hundred years earlier.
He is himself nearly as untrustworthy on really critical points
as his father, and had, I think, less true critical spirit. But
he makes some amends for Julius Cæsar’s truculent assault
on the <span lang="la"><cite>Ciceronianus</cite></span> by confessing that Longolius (the main
object of the Erasmian satire) could not really be said to write
in Ciceronian style when he simply fitted Ciceronian phrases
together.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another member of the group to be noted very especially
is the so-called <span lang="la"><cite>Parrhasiana</cite></span>,<a id='r351'></a><a href='#f351' class='c019'><sup>[351]</sup></a> in the title of which “Théodore
Parrhase” stands for a <span lang="fr"><i>nom de guerre</i></span> of the industrious
pressman Jean Le Clerc. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>and</i> Parrhasiana.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It has very little
in common with its class, being in part a reasoned treatise on
general points of criticism, in part a defence of the author’s own
works against the injurious remarks of Meibomius and others.
The latter we can neglect; the former contains a really interesting
exposition of general critical views by one of the most
experienced of the new class of professional critics and reviewers
at the junction of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries. The distinction of the <cite>Parrhasiana</cite> is that it has
so little distinction—that it is so thoroughly normal. Le Clerc
is a thorough believer in the Ancients; but he wears his rue
with this difference, that he does <em>not</em> believe in moderns who
write Greek and Latin Verses, and that he is quite handsome
and encouraging to those who do write in their mother tongue.
They may be quite, or almost, as useful, he thinks—but as for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>reading for mere amusement, that is not a serious occupation.
And Le Clerc is uncompromising in the prosaism of his views
on poetry. In fact, I am not sure that there is anywhere else
so <span lang="fr"><i>naïf</i></span> a confession of belief in the Lower Reason only. He
finds improbabilities and absurdities, not merely in Homer, but
in Virgil himself; he holds <span lang="la"><i>æternum servans sub pectore vulnus</i></span>,
which some not very fervid Maronites would admit as a great
and poetic phrase, to be a mere surplusage; and he actually
condoles with poets on the unlucky necessity under which they
lie of inversions, metaphors, and so forth, <span lang="la"><i>metri gratia</i></span>. I do
not know whether Mr Arnold knew the <cite>Parrhasiana</cite>, and
indeed should doubt it; but he certainly might have found
chapter and verse for his strictures on the age of “prose and
sense” almost anywhere in it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet other groups or individuals in this abounding period
might receive notice if this history were to be in twelve
volumes instead of in three. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Patru, Desmarets, and others.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> There is Patru, not
merely in his time the glory of the French bar, but
extolled, by Boileau and by his enemies alike, as a
sort of Quintilian and Quintilius in one<a id='r352'></a><a href='#f352' class='c019'><sup>[352]</sup></a>—as a standard at once
of style and of judgment. Yet his long life and his constant
occupation with literature, in talk and in reading, seem to have
left us hardly anything in the shape of written criticism. There
is Desmarets de Saint-Sorlin, a less belauded but more interesting
and perhaps more genuine man of letters. Not merely did
Desmarets compose the epics ridiculed by Boileau, not merely
was he the author of the excellent <span lang="fr"><cite>Visionnaires</cite></span> (the best comedy
in French before Molière except Corneille’s <span lang="fr"><cite>Le Menteur</cite></span>), not
merely was he a “visionary” himself in his latter days, and a
versifier, if not a poet, always, but he was a not inconsiderable
critic. Those who choose to read his <span lang="fr"><cite>Défense du Poème Héroique</cite></span><a id='r353'></a><a href='#f353' class='c019'><sup>[353]</sup></a>
will find in it by no means the imbecility that they may expect,
either in the dialogues defending the Christian poem, or in the
somewhat meticulous, but sharp and not ill-deserved, “cutting-up”
of Boileau which follows. But these, and much more the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>Conrarts and the Costars, the Maucroix, and the rest<a id='r354'></a><a href='#f354' class='c019'><sup>[354]</sup></a> must here
be as <span lang="fr"><i>silencieux</i></span> as the first in his stock epithet. And one may
confess even to doubts whether, with the amplest room and
verge, they ought to have much space in a general History of
Criticism as distinguished from one of special countries and
periods. Hardly any of them is more than one of a <span lang="la"><i>numerus</i></span>;
hardly any has himself actual distinction, as persons of much
inferior talents may have at other times. The Historian of
Climate must have much to say about the delightful variety of
that phenomenon which the British Isles display, about its
causes, its phases, and the like, in general; but he would be lost,
and would lose his readers in more than one sense, if he were to
attempt to describe every shower or even every wet season.<a id='r355'></a><a href='#f355' class='c019'><sup>[355]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The attempts, not merely to make out a regular Æsthetic for
Descartes, but to key this on to the great critical movement of
the century, will be best dealt with later; but the greatest of
the Cartesians must have a word.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>Malebranche need not occupy us long; indeed, this great
philosopher and admirable master of French has to be dealt
with by us, at least in some part, because he has
been dealt with by others. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Malebranche.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The invitation to do so,
if we may say it without illiberality, seems to have consisted
rather in the titles than in the contents of his work. The
Second Book of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Recherche de la Vérité</cite></span> is, indeed, “<span lang="fr">De
l’Imagination</span>”; the Second Part of this Second Book has
much to do with <span lang="fr"><i>les personnes d'étude</i></span>; and the Third, Fourth,
and Fifth chapters of the Third Part deal with “the imagination
of certain authors,” especially Tertullian, Seneca, and
Montaigne. But we have seen, and shall see, how treacherous
the word Imagination is, and how people will misunderstand it,
however frankly they are dealt with. Malebranche, as he
always is, is quite frank and quite clear; he tells us definitely
that imagination for him is “a little more and a little less than
sense,” that it only consists in the power possessed by the soul
of forming images of objects for itself. His quarrel with the
“persons of study” is that they <em>will</em> read, write, and argue
about the ancients, instead of recurring to primary truths;
and when he deals with his three selected authors, it is not to
criticise them from the literary point of view (though he finds
fault with “irregular movements” in Tertullian’s figures), but
to object to the paralogism of the <span lang="la"><cite>De Pallio</cite></span>, the ill-regulated
imagination and feeble reasoning of Seneca, the treacherous
“cavalier” manner, the “criminal attraction born of concupiscence,”
the disguised pedantry, the vanity, in Montaigne.
Phrases here and there, in his own perfect style<a id='r356'></a><a href='#f356' class='c019'><sup>[356]</sup></a> (I doubt
whether any prose writer of the <span lang="fr"><i>grand siècle</i></span> can give points to
Malebranche), show what a critic was lost in him; but the
critic—as indeed we should expect, and as is quite proper—<em>is</em>
lost in the philosopher, the theologian, and the moralist.<a id='r357'></a><a href='#f357' class='c019'><sup>[357]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>And so to Boileau.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>It is desirable that we should examine Boileau’s critical
work<a id='r358'></a><a href='#f358' class='c019'><sup>[358]</sup></a> with more than ordinary care. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The history of Boileau’s reputation.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The history of his
reputation has, until recently, been on the whole not
very different from that of many other eminent men
of letters—that is to say, it has oscillated between
extravagant reverence (during the entire eighteenth century,
with rare exceptions, both in France and elsewhere) and a
violent reaction (when the Romantic movement set in). Pope
and Voltaire may stand as spokesmen of the former period;
Keats and the men of 1830 of the latter. But of late years,
and in England as well as in France, the cant of criticism
(which is as protean, and as immortal, as most such Duessas)
has devised another thing. Even in the extreme Romantic
time, true critics, especially Sainte-Beuve, had recognised how
germane, in wrong as in right, the taste and temper of Boileau
were to the taste and temper of literary France generally, and
to some extent of the Latin peoples old and new. But latterly,
under the powerful influence of M. Ferdinand Brunetière—whom,
though I often disagree with him, I always name for the sake
of most unaffected honour, and as a critic of whom any country
and time might have been proud—this tendency has gone much
further, and we are even asked to accept Monsieur Nicolas as
an adequate representative of the French literary genius. Let
us remember what “adequate” means; it means to a great, at
least, if not to the very fullest, extent commensurate, coextensive,
and complete. And in England also there has been not
wanting an affectation of deference to this estimate—of arguing
that we ought to let the French know best in such points—that
it is wicked, rude, uncritical, to intrude English judgment
into such matters.</p>

<p class='c000'>So be it, for the moment, and for the sake of argument. Let
us then, as we do always, as from this point of view it is more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>specially necessary that we should do, inquire what the <em>actual</em>
criticism of this “adequate” representative of the
French genius is. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> <span lang="fr">Art Poétique</span>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> And in doing this let us begin
with the <span lang="fr"><cite>Art Poétique</cite></span>, that elaborately arranged code of neo-classic
correctness, the composition of which occupied half the
central decade<a id='r359'></a><a href='#f359' class='c019'><sup>[359]</sup></a> of its author’s life when he was in the full
vigour of ripe age, which summed up all the doctrine of his
earlier satires, and is practically repeated by most of his
later.</p>

<p class='c000'>In making the examination we shall (not without considerable
generosity) abstain from bearing too hardly upon the
flagrant ignorance of literary history, even in his
own country, which Boileau here displays. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Its false literary history.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> His
modern defenders (not, it must be confessed, till
those who do not defend him had made uncompromising
championship on this point impossible) practically confess and
avoid it, pass it with a half-petulant “Agreed!” They cannot
well do otherwise: for in the famous lines (I. 113-130) from</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>an amount of crass ignorance, or of impudent falsification, is
amassed which is really curious, and almost creditable, at least
to the audacity of the author’s party-spirit, or the serenity of
his indifference. Even in the oldest French poetry that we
possess, much more in the <span lang="fr"><cite>Roman de la Rose</cite></span> (which he adduces
in a note, having obviously never read it), the “words” were
<em>not</em> “arranged without measure”; there <em>were</em> “strict numbers”;
and there was even a pretty strict cæsura. Villon did not do
anything to “the art of the old romancers,” but wrote in precisely
the same measures as men had written in for a hundred
and fifty years before him. Marot simply adopted ballades,
wrote no triolets, did nothing new to rondeaux, while we are
only unable to convict Boileau of error as to <span lang="fr"><i>mascarades</i></span>, because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>nobody has yet discovered what, exactly, a <span lang="fr"><i>mascarade</i></span> is. The
description of Ronsard’s action is rubbish: while it is quite
certain that both Desportes and Bertaut went to their graves
without the slightest doubt that he was Prince of French poets,
and were not in the least “restrained” in following him. And
the history of the French Drama in Canto Three only deserves
less reprehension because it was really not very easy at the
time for a man to know much about it.</p>

<p class='c000'>But let this suffice. And let us also exercise our perhaps
undeserved generosity on another point, that wholesale and unblushing
imitation of Horace which made the Abbé Cotin, one
of Boileau’s victims, retort with as much truth as wit, in the
very form of one of Despréaux' own insolences—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>After all, though a paradox, it is not an impossibility, that a
man should be a great critic and yet most untrustworthy on
literary history, and apt to make his own work, in great part,
a mere mosaic of the work of others.</p>

<p class='c000'>Let us then take the <span lang="fr"><cite>Art Poétique</cite></span> simply as criticism—not
as a series of statements of fact, not as an original or a borrowed
argument—and see how it looks this way.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Abstract of it.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The first Canto begins (in the teasing inverted style<a id='r361'></a><a href='#f361' class='c019'><sup>[361]</sup></a>
which was one of Boileau’s worst legacies to French poetry, and
which itself was a “corrupt following” of Latin) with a declaration
of the necessity of genius, which has been counted to him
for much righteousness. Everybody has not the genius for
everything, and it does not follow that because you have a
genius for convivial songs you have one for Epic. But good
sense and reason are as necessary as genius. Indeed we are
soon told that writing depends on these <em>alone</em> for its value: so
that genius is like those tickets of admission which are quite
useless till they are countersigned by somebody other than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>the issuer. Never try high flights or conceits. Do not
describe your subjects or objects too minutely. Cultivate
variety, but never be “low,” burlesque, or bombastic. Whatever
you do, mind cæsura and avoid hiatus. Then follows the
pseudo-history referred to above, capped by its phrase of Malherbe,
in whose steps you are to walk. Clearness of expression
is of the greatest value; but as a fact it depends on clearness
of thought. Smart things will not ransom faults. If you fear
criticism, anticipate it by yourself and your friends; but beware
of flatteries, and, above all, do not take the part of your
own faults simply because your friends have noticed them.
The First Canto ends with the really excellent line, in Boileau’s
true vein (for, whatsoe’er the failings on his part as a critic, he
was a satirist born and bred)—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr">“Un sot trouve toujours un plus sot qui l’admire.”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>The Second Canto begins, <span lang="fr"><i>apropos</i></span> of nothing (indeed Boileau
was frankly troubled about his “transitions”), with a discussion,
partly metaphorical, of the Idyll, Eclogue, and Pastoral, followed
by a similar account of other kinds of shorter pieces—Elegy,
Ode, Sonnet, Epigram, and others, down to Vaudeville—the Fable
being absent, to the discomfort and laborious excuse-making of
the disciples. The Idyll must be neither too pompous nor too
trivial: follow Theocritus and Virgil and all will be right. Elegy
is proper for Death and Love; but you must not, in regard to
the latter, be frigid and hackneyed. Imitate Tibullus and
Ovid, and again all will be right. The ode is worthy of Achilles
or Louis; but do not be too historical—which indeed would be
difficult in regard to Achilles, and might be inconvenient in regard
to Louis. Sonnets are very difficult, but a sonnet without
fault is by itself worth an Epic.<a id='r362'></a><a href='#f362' class='c019'><sup>[362]</sup></a> The epigram may have
<span lang="fr"><i>pointes</i></span>, which are elsewhere to be utterly rejected. The other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>kinds are lightly treated till the Satire, descending to the <span lang="fr"><i>vaudeville</i></span>,
has a longer discussion. Satire, the apologist <span lang="la"><i>pro domo</i></span>
declares, is the voice of Truth. Lucilius, Horace, Juvenal, are
characterised. Regnier is <em>our</em> best man; but his style is antiquated,
and his subjects and language are really shocking.<a id='r363'></a><a href='#f363' class='c019'><sup>[363]</sup></a>
Then “the Frenchman, <span lang="fr"><i>né malin</i></span>,” made the Vaudeville. It is
only fair to Boileau to say that, could he have foreseen the
tedious abuse of this <span lang="fr"><i>mot</i></span>, he would certainly either have forborne
it, or have given us a capital line or couplet to tie to the
tail of the culprits. Canto Three passes, with no less abruptness,
to the drama, which occupies the first half, the latter part being
given to the Epic. Boileau is at first vague. In fact, he does
not seem at all thoroughly to have appreciated the Aristotelian
doctrine, which in the main he runs up as his flag. Dramatic
art in teaching must please and touch, which it may do by exciting
pity and terror. Do not make a long and obscure introduction;
keep the Unities as you value your dramatic salvation;
never be incredible; and let everything contribute to
the development of your story.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Historic Muse reappears, but in such case, as hinted
above, that we shall magnanimously abstain from further vengeance
on her. If only Boileau had omitted the unhappy note
which says that <span lang="fr"><i>leurs pièces</i></span> (those of his imaginary <span lang="fr"><i>pélerins</i></span>)
<span lang="fr"><i>sont imprimées</i></span>, thereby suggesting that he had read them!
You must have Love: but do not be <span lang="fr"><i>doucereux</i></span>; keep the stock
characters; do not modernise the ancients; and if you invent
a personage let him be constant to himself. The theatre really
is very difficult. But Epic is still more so. It depends entirely
upon action, upon fable; and in order to make it noble you put
in the <span lang="la"><i>deorum ministerium</i></span>.<a id='r364'></a><a href='#f364' class='c019'><sup>[364]</sup></a> Æneas’ voyage would have been
quite an ordinary thing without Juno, and Neptune, and
Æolus:—</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>But the modern deity will not do at all; and devils and
angels are worse. Do let us keep our Tritons, our Parcæ, our
Pan, and our Charon! If not, in a short time we shall not be
able to tie a bandage on the eyes of Themis, or put a balance in
her hand!<a id='r366'></a><a href='#f366' class='c019'><sup>[366]</sup></a> Further, be very careful of your names. There
was a person once who actually called his hero Childebrand!
Minor receipts for handling follow; and then we find ourselves
back on the stage with Comedy, as to which Boileau extols
Nature, and tells us that Molière would have been the best of
comic dramatists—if he had been other than he was.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Fourth Canto returns to the generalities of the first,
and, taking advantage of this wider scope, begins an attack,
not unamusing but in very bad taste, on Claude Perrault, architect,
doctor, and, like his more celebrated brother Charles, and
a third not so well known as either, a champion on the modern
side (<i>v. infra</i>). It ends, in accordance with the habits of the
age, in an elaborate and rather well-declaimed panegyric of the
king, wherein the adroit historiographer supplies an epilogue
to the perhaps not quite so adroit critic.</p>

<p class='c000'>For some lines in the middle Boileau, though constantly
returning to the crutch of Horace, does occupy himself with
literature. His precepts may be thus summarised. Whatever
you are, be not a bad writer, and if you <em>must</em> be, be rather
bombastic than cold; but, on the whole, degrees of mediocrity
do not much matter. Here the satirist once more comes to the
rescue and dictates the (in application insolent,<a id='r367'></a><a href='#f367' class='c019'><sup>[367]</sup></a> but) intrinsically
good couplet—</p>

<p class='c008'>Do not pay attention to flatterers (we had heard this before), do
not excuse your verses, but keep an open ear for every comment:
though you must be careful to separate foolish from wise criticisms.
Join the solid and useful to the pleasant. Let your

but respect principle and the young person. Do not be jealous
of your rivals; do not put literature above its proper place; for

depends on the success of a sonnet. Of this last ignoble gibe
(too much imitated, alas! by our own Pope) we need take no
further notice; and we shall say nothing more on any of the
other points in Boileau which invite unfavourable comment, but
are not strictly critical. Let us judge him as a critic only, and
first on this piece.</p>

<p class='c000'>Is it good criticism?</p>

<p class='c000'>This of course is far too large a question to answer off-hand.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Critical examination of it.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> We must hunt the answer to it by the way of minor questions,
such as, Is it original? (the least important but of
some importance). If it is not, What does it add to,
and how ingeniously and usefully does it apply, the
original from which it borrows? What methods does it use?
To what extent and in what fashion would a poet adopting it as
a manual be qualified for his art? And lastly (though perhaps
some minor questions may crop up in our passage), What incidental
excellences does it contain? What is the merit of the
critical estimates which the author makes, in passing or with
deliberation, of the authors, great and small, of the past and
the present?</p>

<p class='c000'>Let us take these questions in order, and see what answers
the <span lang="fr"><cite>Art Poétique</cite></span>, examined without prejudice, but without fear<a id='r370'></a><a href='#f370' class='c019'><sup>[370]</sup></a>
or favour, can give to them.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>As to the first question there is, to a certain extent, no
difference of opinion. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Want of originality.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The injured Cotin undoubtedly had
truth on his side, in the parody quoted above, as to a
large part of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Art Poétique</cite></span>. But what has not
been quite sufficiently recognised is that this is the best part.
Take away the almost (sometimes quite) literal translations
from Horace, and you will take away Boileau’s backbone; take
away the Horatian suggestions, and you will go far to deprive
his criticism of its skeleton altogether, and leave it a mere
jumble of promiscuous observations. It would be interesting
and by no means otiose—if one only had the money and the
time—to print the <span lang="fr"><cite>Art Poétique</cite></span> with the direct Horatian
borrowment in rubric, the suggested passages in black italic,
and the mere personalities, illustrations, flatteries, lampoons,
and the like, in, say, blue. But I fear the remains in ordinary
print would be wofully small, and still more wofully unimportant.
This, however, would not matter so very much if
Boileau had been strikingly original in what he adds, or had
applied the Horatian doctrine with striking appropriateness to
the altered condition of literature. One would think it impossible,
if distinguished instances to the contrary were not
known, for any one to maintain that he has done either.
By far the greater part of the achievements of modern, and
practically the whole of the achievements of mediæval, literature
up to his time, are simply ignored, or, where referred to,
ridiculously misdescribed. Nay more, Horatian parallels are
got in by inventing a history of what never existed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor could anything else possibly happen, considering the
methods which Boileau chose to adopt. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Faults of method.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> These methods are,
First, the construction of a Horatian-Aristotelian
bed to which everything has to be adjusted in point
of principle; and of this it is not necessary to say more.
Secondly, the suggestion as models, at every turn, of Latin and
(much less often) Greek poets, utterly regardless of the change
of circumstances. Thirdly, the method of criticism by Kinds—of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>laying down the rules for, and discussing the ends of, the
abstract Pastoral, the abstract Elegy, the abstract Sonnet, Ode,
and so forth, with only a few perfunctory eulogies of actual
examples. In regard to the first and second it is enough to
quote the critic’s own words against him, and ask him how
Ovid or Tibullus can be a sufficient, can be even a safe, guide
to a French love-poet, and how the marvels of ancient mythology
can become the “machinery” of a modern epic? In
regard to the third, the old battering-ram must be once more
applied. Pastoral, Elegy, Ode, and the rest (except “Sonnet,”
which is a <em>form</em>) are not unequivocal names applied to abstractly
existing things, but mere tickets. Give me a poem,
and I will tell you whether I think it a good or a bad poem,
and why. You may, after that, if you have the time and care
to take the trouble, classify it as epic or elegy, epigram or ode.
But the box in which you choose to deposit it does not really
matter in the least; and if it should so happen that there
is no box ready, you must either make, or do without, one. Is
the poem good or bad as poetry?—that is the <span lang="la"><i>articulus stantis
vel cadentis criticismi</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the most surprising thing in Boileau’s method, and the
most fatal, is the thing on which he prides himself most,
and which has been most commended in him—the
perpetual appeal to Good Sense and Reason.<a id='r371'></a><a href='#f371' class='c019'><sup>[371]</sup></a> <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Obsession of good sense.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It
is surprising, because Longinus, whom he strangely assumed
to be a prophet after his own heart, had warned him amply, and
one might think irresistibly, some fifteen hundred years before.
“Heights of eloquence or of poetry, but especially of poetry,”
that mighty critic had said, “do not lead to persuasion <em>but to
ecstasy</em>.” Now it is with Persuasion only—in the Greek sense,
which includes intellectual conviction and practical influence—that
Good Sense and Reason, in Boileau’s sense, can deal. It
is true that very glaring offences against them may sometimes
(by no means always) interfere with Ecstasy; but the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>heroic doses of either or both will never cause it. Generally
speaking—the saying has of course the danger of the double
edge, but it is true for all that—when Good Sense comes in
at the door Ecstasy flies out of the window, and when Ecstasy
flies in at the window, Good Sense and (the lower) Reason
retire prudishly by the door. At any rate, if they remain, it will
be necessary for them to keep themselves very much in the
background, and wait till they are called for. They may very
well act as detectives and catchpolls when False Ecstasy usurps
the place of true; but like other police-officers they have rather
an awkward habit of mistaking their men. Every respect is
of course to be paid to them; their assistance is sometimes
very welcome and valuable even to the poet, while the prose-writer
can seldom dispense with their constant surveillance.
But even the latter may sometimes be hindered of his finest
effects by looking first to them; while the Poet who does so
will never rise beyond the lower-middle slopes of Parnassus, if
he even reaches these.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, unless these considerations can be got out of the way,
the answer to yet a further question, What help does Boileau
give the Poet? will be a most meagre and disappointing one.
Some of the positive helps which he offers—the rule of Good
Sense, and the empty forms of Kinds—are likely to be, in the
first case positively mischievous, in the second rather hindering
than helpful. His historical doctrine is usually wrong, and,
where not wrong, inadequate. His constant prescription of
“the ancients”—not merely as <em>general</em> guides in literature—nobody
need ask for better—but as immediate and particular
models for all kinds of literary exercise, will in its most rigorous
observation make a mere translating anachronist, and even if
more freely construed, will again hinder much more than it
helps.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the majority of Boileau’s counsels are not positive at all,
they are simply negative: and negative counsels in art, when
the pupil is once out of schoolboyhood, never did
much good yet, and have often done a great deal of
harm. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Arbitrary proscriptions.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Why should his <span lang="la"><i>risus ineptus</i></span> at the name “Childebrand”
proscribe that name, which is euphonious enough to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>unprejudiced ears? What “sensible and reasonable” (we may
thank him for these words) criterion of sound makes “Philis”
preferable to “Toinon” or, prettier still, Toinette? It is true,
doubtless, that, for a continuance, the long Alexandrine divides
best at the middle; but what reason, what sense is there in the
absolute proscription of a penthemimeral or hephthemimeral
cæsura? In what does the welcoming of Pan and Charon,
and the banishing of Ashtaroth and Beelzebub, differ from the
immortal decision that “blue uniforms are only good for the
artillery and the Blue Horse”? And so throughout.</p>

<p class='c000'>But, it will be said, the <span lang="fr"><cite>Art Poétique</cite></span> is not Boileau’s sole
critical deliverance. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Boileau’s other works.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It is most true; in fact, though his work
is for a man who went safely beyond the three score
years and ten and half-way to the four score,<a id='r372'></a><a href='#f372' class='c019'><sup>[372]</sup></a> a
rather scanty work, it is pervaded with literature and with
criticism. By a curious contrast to those Roman satirists, of
whom we spoke erstwhile, his criticism of life is always turning
to literature. The admirable heroi-comic satire of the <cite>Lutrin</cite>
itself gravitates somehow or other to the battle in the book-shop,
which enables the poet to gibbet his victims once more;
not to mention that the whole fun of this very <cite>Lutrin</cite> is (though
Boileau did not in the least know it) a sort of <span lang="la"><i>reductio ad
absurdum</i></span> of his own critical doctrines in the <cite>Art</cite>. Most of the
other pieces are either directly critical of a kind, or the expression
of brief and rather reluctantly obeyed avocations from
criticism. Let us examine them,—though with somewhat less
minuteness.</p>

<p class='c000'>The dominance of the literary subject in the <cite>Satires</cite> is well
known, though it is equally notorious that illiberal
personality too often takes the place of liberal
criticism. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Satires.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Colletet’s poverty and parasitism; Saint-Amant’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>death from fever, brought on by his ill-success (he would have
died of hunger anyhow, says the satirist good-naturedly)—these
are the subjects that interest him in the First. In the Second
to Molière, with oblique censure of, or at least surprise at the
easy versification of the dramatist, he bewails (being evidently
proud of it) his own studious “difficulty”<a id='r373'></a><a href='#f373' class='c019'><sup>[373]</sup></a> in rhyming, jests at
the stock phrases and <span lang="fr"><i>chevilles</i></span> of others from Ménage to Scudéry.
Even in the Third—the old bad-dinner satire of Horace and
Regnier—he brings in a literary quarrel about Théophile and
Ronsard and Quinault. The Fifth, to Dangeau, is one of the
few which have hardly any literary touches. But he will drag
the luckless Abbé de Pure into the Sixth on the noises and
nuisances of Paris, while the Seventh is wholly literary, and is
one of the earliest (1663) of his explosions at bad poets, and
the Eighth, on the follies of humanity, naturally takes shots at
the old target.</p>

<p class='c000'>All these, however, much more the awkward Tenth, on Women,
and the very inferior Eleventh, must give place to the Ninth, an
imitation of Horace, II. vii., written in the author’s fortieth or
forty-first year, nominally to defend himself for his former
attacks on his compeers, but really, of course, to renew them.
Once more his favourite equivalents (only mentioned <span lang="la"><i>infamiæ
causa</i></span>) for Gyas and Cloanthus—Colletet, Pelletier, Quinault,
and the rest—appear. Once more Racan receives partial, and
Théophile almost total, insult. Here is the famous contrast of
<span lang="fr"><i>le clinquant du Tasse</i></span> and <span lang="fr"><i>l’or de Virgile</i></span>; and here the still more
famous lines on the <cite>Cid</cite>, embedded in—and plainly owing their
complimentary tone to the fact that they are embedded in—an
onslaught on Chapelain. Again and again the luckless Cotin is
“horsed” and justified: while the almost equally luckless
Pelletier<a id='r374'></a><a href='#f374' class='c019'><sup>[374]</sup></a> serves as a foil to “<span lang="fr">d’Ablancourt et Patru.</span>” The
singular posthumous piece <cite>Sur l'Équivoque</cite>, appended usually as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>the Twelfth satire, is a sort of attempt to generalise and amplify
the author’s horror of conceit and obscurity.</p>

<p class='c000'>To dwell on the minor pieces of verse, which are often literary,
would be here impossible; it is enough to say that they include
the two epigrams on Corneille’s <span lang="fr"><cite>Agésilas</cite></span> and <span lang="fr"><cite>Attila</cite></span>,
and numerous assaults on Perrault. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Epigrams <i>and</i> Epistles.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The <cite>Epistles</cite> are
not nearly so full of our matter as the <cite>Satires</cite>; but
the Seventh (to Racine on the success of the opposition <cite>Phèdre</cite>
by the hated Pradon) and the Tenth (on his own verses) belong
to us. The first of these has been very highly, and in part
quite deservedly, praised. The reference to the death and the
almost dishonoured grave of Molière, though slightly theatrical,
is both vigorous and really touching; the eulogy of Racine
himself is, in the circumstances, but allowably excessive; and
the half-flattering, half-boasting mention of his own enjoyment
of the favour of the “great,” from Louis to La Rochefoucauld,
would be tolerable if it were not mainly a vehicle for fresh abuse
of Linière and Tallemant, of Perrin and Pradon himself.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Prose—The</i> <span lang="fr">Héros de Roman;</span> <i>the</i> <span lang="fr">Réflexions sur Longin.</span></div>

<p class='c000'>The prose is equally saturated with criticism. The dialogue
on <span lang="fr"><cite>Les Héros de Roman</cite></span>, which Fontenelle could have done
admirably, Boileau has not done very well; but his satire
on the extraordinary bastard kind of romance with
which France at this time deluged Europe is not ill-founded,
though rather ill-informed.<a id='r375'></a><a href='#f375' class='c019'><sup>[375]</sup></a> The Letters
are full enough of criticism. But the two chief
prose documents from which (at least from their
titles) something really important may be expected, are the
<cite>Dissertation</cite> on the story of Giocondo, as told by its inventor and
by La Fontaine, and the <span lang="fr"><cite>Réflexions sur Longin</cite></span>. These last,
however, the reader need hardly trouble himself with: they
may even be classed among the impieties of criticism. Boileau,
little as he could have appreciated, did at least know the Great
Unknown. He translated him; he calls him very truly <span lang="fr"><i>le plus
grand</i></span>, and more questionably <span lang="fr"><i>le plus sévère</i></span>, of ancient critics.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>But these <span lang="fr"><cite>Réflexions</cite></span> on Longinus are in fact reflections on Charles
Perrault, a very clever person, but not in the least like
Longinus: and the texts from the Περὶ Ὕψους, which are put
at the head of each chapter, often have nothing to do with the
subject at all, and in almost every case might almost as well
have been selected from the first book he picked up. In the
particular dispute I am with him, and not with Perrault; but
the first exclamation of any real lover of the real classics who
reads the piece must be <span lang="la"><i>Non tali auxilio</i></span>! Boileau, as always,
is arrogant and rude; as sometimes elsewhere his scholarship is
not beyond suspicion, though it had an easy triumph over the
almost total absence of the same quality in his adversary; but,
as he is very seldom, he is confused, desultory, heavy. To those
who think that criticism is the art of scolding, the <span lang="fr"><cite>Réflexions sur
Longin</cite></span> may seem to be a creditable exercise in it: hardly to
others.</p>

<p class='c000'>Almost the only critical essay of the proper kind that we
have from this famous critic is the other piece mentioned above—the
“Dissertation on the <span lang="fr"><cite>Joconde</cite></span>.” <span class='sni side12'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The “Dissertation on</i> Joconde.”<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The occasion
was not unpromising. A certain M. de Saint-Gilles,
seriously or otherwise, had preferred the version of
Ariosto’s tale by one Bouillon to that of La Fontaine, and the
question (which had taken the form of a bet between Saint-Gilles
and La Mothe le Vayer de Bretigny) was referred to
Boileau for decision. I confess that I have never taken the
trouble to look up the works of M. de Bouillon: the specimens
that Boileau gives are quite enough, and he exercises his ferule
like the vigorous and (within limits) accurate and useful pedagogue
that he is. But, unluckily, he thinks it necessary not
merely to prefer La Fontaine to Bouillon, but to belittle
Ariosto<a id='r376'></a><a href='#f376' class='c019'><sup>[376]</sup></a> in favour of La Fontaine. I defy anybody—Frenchman
or non-Frenchman—to have, within certain limits, a
greater admiration for La Fontaine than I have; and I am
heretical enough to like the <span lang="fr"><cite>Contes</cite></span> even better than the <span lang="fr"><cite>Fables</cite></span>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>But why this miserable setting of two great things against each
other? Why not like both? This is what critics of the Boileau
type cannot do: they must have their rat-pit of false comparison,
their setting-by-the-ears, their belittling in order to exalt. It
must be said that Boileau is justly punished. His usual critical
censures are so vague and general—he is so apt to tell us that
So-and-so is a bad poet without showing us <em>how</em> he is bad—that
he escapes confutation. Not so here. In the first place he
shows, as perhaps we might have anticipated, that worst of
critical defects, an inability to “take” his author. He is very
angry with the famous grave beginning of the tavern-keeper’s
much less than grave story—the stately <span lang="it"><i>Astolfo, re de' Longobardi</i></span>,
and the rest. He thinks that “<span lang="fr">le bon messer Ludovico</span>”
had forgotten, or rather did not care for, the precept of his
Horace, <span lang="la">“Versibus exponi tragicis res comica non vult.”</span></p>

<p class='c000'>Undoubtedly Messer Ludovico did not care one of his favourite
turnips for it! And, according to the key of humour in which
he was writing—a key struck before him, but never so well as
by him, in Italian, familiar in English, but unknown in French
till recently—he was quite right in this negligence. Boileau
proceeds to give rules for “telling an absurd thing in such a
manner as to intimate to the reader that you do not yourself
believe it.” Very good; that is the <span lang="fr"><cite>Lutrin</cite></span> way—a capital way
too; but not the only one. And Ariosto is at least entitled
to try this other, in which he succeeds so admirably to all who
have eyes or ears and will use them. The critic, again, is very
angry with Ariosto for making Giocondo abstain from poniarding
his wife because of the love he bore her. “<span lang="fr">Il n’y a point de
passion plus tragique et plus violente que la jalousie qui naît
d’un extrème amour.</span>” Let us not remark too unkindly that
Despréaux' knowledge of <span lang="fr"><i>un extrème amour</i></span> was, by all accounts,
including his own, the reverse of experimental. His error is
more widespreading. It is part of that unlucky arrangement
of “typed” kinds—not less of character and passion than of
writing—which the neo-classic system insists upon. Your
passions, like your poetic forms, are all pigeon-holed, and their
conduct prescribed to them. You must “keep the type” once
more. <span lang="fr"><i>Pour le bonheur du genre humain</i></span>, Ariosto knew better.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>We must not, tempting as it is, dwell on the plea that
Giocondo’s honest agony, “<span lang="fr">a quelque chose de tragique qui ne
vaut rien dans un conte à rire,</span>” while La Fontaine’s easy-going
wittol is quite a cheerful object; on the inestimable cry of outraged
verisimilitude, “<span lang="fr">Où est-ce que Joconde trouve si vite une
hostie sacrée pour faire jurer le roi?</span>” or on the extraordinary
casuistry as to the time occupied, in the two versions, by the
climax of the triple arrangement of Fiammetta. In this, as
in the remarkable letter of reconciliation to Perrault,<a id='r377'></a><a href='#f377' class='c019'><sup>[377]</sup></a> one
is at first inclined to suspect irony; but in neither case will
the hypothesis work out. Here Boileau presents what looks
like a caricature of the “classical” criticism; yet it exactly
coincides with his general precepts elsewhere. There he gives
away almost, not quite, the whole of the Ancient case by admitting
the superiority of the moderns after a fashion which,
if we took it to be ironical, would reflect upon his own familiar
friends and patterns—Molière, La Fontaine, and Racine.</p>

<p class='c000'>In fact, recent and repeated reading of Boileau has made me
doubt whether he had <em>any</em> critical principle, except that of
Good Sense. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>A “Solifidian of Good Sense.”</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He almost says so in so many words
in the <span lang="fr"><cite>Art Poétique</cite></span>; his general or particular sayings
elsewhere say it over again with mere change of
name and instance. If he loved the classics, it was because
the classics he knew best—the Latins of the Augustan age—do
probably observe this “good-sense” standard more than any
other great writers of any time but his own. And if he was
unjust to the great writers of the time just before his own, and
savage to the small among his contemporaries, it was because
the prevailing fashion, for two or three generations, had set in a
direction which Good Sense alone must constantly disapprove.
Now Good Sense is not a high tribunal, but a very low one,—we
were better off with our old friend Furor Poeticus, though
he did sometimes talk, and encourage the talking of, nonsense.
The mere “Solifidian” of Good Sense knows nothing, and can
know nothing, about poetry.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nay more, one may ask without real impertinence, Is Boileau’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span><span lang="fr"><cite>Art Poétique</cite></span> in any vital and important sense an Art of Poetry
at all, any more than it is an Art of Pig-breeding, or of Pottery-making,
or of Pyrotechnics? In all these useful and agreeable
pursuits—for the matter of that in all other arts, trades, professions,
employments, and vocations—it is desirable to know
what you are about, to proceed cautiously and sensibly, to
choose the right materials, to combine them in the right way,
not to go beyond your powers and means, to vary your appeals
to the public, to take good advice, to observe the practice of
proved success in the particular department, to study its kinds
and species carefully, not to launch out too far nor restrain your
operations too much, and to observe the laws of morality and
propriety throughout. But what is there specially <em>poetical</em> in
all this? Or what does Boileau add to this to make his treatise
specially poetical? A few—decidedly few—technical cautions
of the lower kind, not all of them unquestionable; some general
or mediate rules, mostly borrowed from Horace, and not a few
of them more questionable still; some literary history which,
as we have seen, is utterly worthless; and a seasoning of mostly
spiteful hits at poets he dislikes.</p>

<p class='c000'>But, they say—and this is practically the stronghold to which

and French poetry. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The plea for his practical services.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Look at the badness of the
styles he attacked, and the completeness with which

Can you possibly deny this merit?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Let nothing be denied—or, for the matter of that, affirmed—before
everything has been considered. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Historical examination of this.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> What are the facts?
Boileau came at the end—at the very end—of a
stage of French poetry which had been rather a
long one, and unquestionably one of very chequered
and not very highly distinguished performance. The somewhat
hasty theories, and the often splendid, but nearly always
unequal, practice of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Pléiade</cite></span>, had given place to a sort of
rococo individualism, to the bastard and easily ignoble kinds
of parody and burlesque, or to corrupt followings of Spanish
and Italian practice. Many charming, and some fine, things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>(including that stately passage of Chapelain’s which many
classical critics, who scoff at his name, have admired when
all but literally translated in <cite>The Deserted Village</cite>) had been
written; but the writers had constantly dropped from them to
the trivial and the bombastic. But when Boileau began seriously
to write in 1663-64,<a id='r378'></a><a href='#f378' class='c019'><sup>[378]</sup></a> this period was in its very last
stage. It could not have lasted much, or any, longer if there
had been no Boileau at all. Of his actual victims some were
long dead; others were very old men; the younger were persons
of no importance, <span lang="la"><i>ephemera</i></span>, whether critical or poetical, which
would have died with the day. The smoky torch of Théophile—a
true poetic torch for all its smoke—had flickered out nearly
forty years before. Cyrano, to whom Boileau gives contemptuous
blessing in part, only that he may ban him and others more
effectively, had slept in peace for eight years. Saint-Amant,
who had real poetic gift, and who, if he was no scholar in the
ancient tongues, knew the modern in a fashion which puts
Boileau’s ignorance of their literatures to shame, had met the
end described so feelingly by his critic some three years earlier.
Chapelain was a man of sixty-seven; Cotin one of sixty. It
is by attacking not the dead and decrepit, but the young and
rising, that a man shows himself a great warrior and a useful
citizen in criticism. In fact, the principles of correctness
which Boileau espoused had, as we have seen, been practically
taken up long before, even by poor creatures like the Abbé
d’Aubignac, in certain departments, and Chapelain himself had
smitten in this sense before he felt the wounds.</p>

<p class='c000'>Still less can Boileau be allowed any credit for the great
achievements which undoubtedly took place during his own
middle life. The glories of French literature in verse (and, as
far as the three first go, in poetry), about 1664, are Corneille,
Racine, La Fontaine, Molière. Corneille had been writing
before Boileau was born: the only piece of his which Boileau
praises generously was produced in the year of the critic’s
birth; and that critic is silent about most of the Master’s work,
and sneers ignobly at its later examples. The magnificent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>genius of Molière owed nothing to Boileau in its beginnings,
and accepted little, if anything, from his criticism in its perfection;
while not all of its results were cordially welcomed by
the critic, personal friends as they were. La Fontaine, an older
man than Boileau by fifteen years, was still more independent
of him at the beginning, shows extremely little mark of any
influence from him at any time, and, for all their friendship,
experienced from him the almost unaccountable omission of his
favourite kind, the Fable (unlike the <span lang="fr"><cite>Conte</cite></span>, a perfectly “unobjectionable”
one), in the <span lang="fr"><cite>Art Poétique</cite></span> itself. There remains
Racine, and, if the schooling and training of Racine seem to any
one so great a thing that his schoolmaster and trainer becomes,
<span lang="la"><i>ipso facto</i></span>, one of the <span lang="de"><cite>Di majores</cite></span> of criticism, there is not much
more to be said. But there is something: and it is this. In
the first place, to assume that Racine’s genius could not have
made its own way without Boileau’s mentorship, is to pay a
far worse compliment to that genius than some not very fervent
Racinians can allow; and, in the second, the spirit, if not the
letter, of his criticism is against that of Racine’s very best work.
If I cared to do so, I think I could show that <span lang="fr"><cite>Phèdre</cite></span> herself
comes within the Bolæan<a id='r379'></a><a href='#f379' class='c019'><sup>[379]</sup></a> maledictions. As for <span lang="fr"><cite>Athalie</cite></span>, the
very admirers of Boileau have asked how, after his unsparing
censure of the religious epic, he could tolerate the religious
drama?</p>

<p class='c000'>Have we done? Not quite. After such a reformation, after
such labours of Hercules as we have held up to us, we are
entitled to expect a new crop, a new breed of poets rising
everywhere from the purged and heartened land. Is the poetic
product of the last quarter of the seventeenth century in
France so admirable, so refreshing, such a contrast to the
period of Chapelain and Saint-Amant? I have some small
acquaintance with French literature, but I am unable to supply
the names of the “Poets like Shakespeare, Beautiful souls,”
who, formed by the precepts of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Art Poétique</cite></span>, rush in crowds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>upon the sight during that period. But, it will be said, time
must be given—the French poetry of the <em>eighteenth</em> century is
the work of Boileau through his disciples. It is: and by these
fruits may he and they be justly judged. He cannot, indeed,
claim the admirable light work of Piron and the rest: some of
it very nearly, or quite, incurs his anathemas, and all is composed
more or less outside his precepts, and in accordance with
the practice of La Fontaine rather than with his. But he can
claim the <span lang="fr"><cite>Henriade</cite></span>, and, <em>in part</em>, the odes of J. B. Rousseau—he
may be permitted even to assume the laurels of Delille and of
Le Brun—<span lang="fr"><cite>Pindare</cite></span>. Perhaps, despite the sacred adage, the
growth of the thorn does indicate the strength and genuineness
of the vine, and, perhaps, it can only be a fig which is so fertile
in such stately thistles.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the real weakness of Boileau’s criticism does not fully
appear till we come to examine him on the true ground. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Concluding remarks on him.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> What
are his actual critical deliverances, on concrete
critical points, worth? We have seen something of
the answer to this already. A certain amount of
his condemning censure—though nearly always expressed without
urbaneness, without humanity, with the hectoring and
bullying tone of an ill-conditioned schoolmaster, or the venom
of a spiteful rival—must be validated; there is no lack of bad
writers at any time, and Boileau’s provided a plentiful crop of
them. But in most instances these writers were unimportant
weeds, who would have been cast into the oven on the morrow
of their flourishing, if Boileau had never written a line. On
the other hand, in regard to the two greatest writers, in verse
or drama, of his own day and country, Corneille and Molière,
he loses no opportunity of censuring the one, and accords, till
after his death, but faint and limited praise to the other.
Even his misbeloved ancients he cannot praise with the mingled
enthusiasm and acuteness that mark Longinus, or even Dionysius.
The great merit of Virgil, in his eyes, is that Virgil
manages mythological “machines” so deftly: and, if we look
elsewhere at what he says of writers so different as Æschylus
and Ovid, we shall find a flat generality, with no attempt even
at the <span lang="fr"><i>mot propre</i></span>. Only on the satirists, at least on Horace
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>and Juvenal, is he better. For Boileau, as we have said, was
a satirist to the core, to the finger-tips, and here he speaks as
he feels. If we want his opinion on great modern foreign poets,
we have it explicitly on Tasso and Ariosto, implicitly in his
silence about almost everybody else.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am not conscious of any unfairness or omission, though I
do not pretend to a mere colourless impartiality, in this survey;
and after it I think we may go back to the general question,
may ask, Is this a great or even a good critic? and may answer
it in the negative. That Boileau was important to his own time
may be granted; that he was no ill scavenger of certain sorts
of literary rubbish may be granted; that he gave help to those
who chose to tread in the limited path to which France was
confining herself, so that they might tread it with somewhat
more grace, with much more of firmness and confidence than
they would otherwise have done—that, in short, he did for
France something of the same kind as that which Dryden did
for England, may be granted. This is not exactly a small thing.
But before we call it a great one we must look at the other side.
Boileau did not, like Dryden, leave escapes and safety-valves to
the spirit that was too mighty for the narrower channels of poetic
style; he exhibited none of his contemporary’s catholicity of
mind and taste; he had none of his noble enthusiasms, none
of his constructive power and progressive flexibility in positive
critical estimate. The good that he did is terribly chequered
by the consideration that, in sharpening certain edges of the
French mind, he blunted and distorted others in a fashion which,
after two hundred years, has not been fully remedied. A great
man of letters, perhaps; a craftsmanlike “finisher of the law,”
and no ill pedagogue in literature certainly: but a great critic?
Scarcely, I think.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two writers at least, whom few would call lesser men of letters
than Boileau, and in whom some may see greater qualifications
for criticism, must be much more briefly dealt with,
partly because in their case no controversy is needed,
partly because their actual contributions to criticism form but
a very small part of their work, and partly also because neither
aimed at for himself, or has received from posterity and tradition,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>any very prominent place as a critic. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>La Bruyère and Fénelon.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> These are La
Bruyère and Fénelon. It would not be correct to say that
either is in deliberate or conscious opposition to the <span lang="fr"><i>législateur
du Parnasse</i></span>. Their general conscious principles are much the
same as his; they are, like him, uncompromising defenders
of the Ancients, and though Fénelon has a private crotchet
about poetic prose, yet the non-essentiality of verse to poetry
had been a general, if not a universal, tenet with antiquity.
But whether in consequence of that impatience of despotism
which those who love to mix literary and political history have
seen in the second generation of the <span lang="fr"><i>siècle de Louis XIV.</i></span>, as
compared with the first; or from the fact that, as compared with
Boileau, they were much more of Greek,<a id='r380'></a><a href='#f380' class='c019'><sup>[380]</sup></a> and less of purely
Latin students; or simply as a result of what has been justly
attributed to both,<a id='r381'></a><a href='#f381' class='c019'><sup>[381]</sup></a> the predominance of the <span lang="fr"><i>sens propre</i></span> over
mere observation of the <span lang="la"><i>communis sensus</i></span>—it is certain that both,
and especially Fénelon, display much more individualism, and
at the same time much more catholicity. It may be added
that they know more, and are to some extent (though to no
large one) free from that hopeless ignoring of older French
literature which was Boileau’s greatest fault.</p>

<p class='c000'>La Bruyère’s<a id='r382'></a><a href='#f382' class='c019'><sup>[382]</sup></a> contribution is contained in the opening section,
“<span lang="fr">Des Ouvrages de l’Esprit,</span>” of his famous <span lang="fr"><cite>Caractères</cite></span>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The <span lang="fr">“Des Ouvrages de l’Esprit.”</span></i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It
is not very long; it is—according to the plan of
the work it is not merely entitled but obliged to be—studiously
desultory; and it is not perhaps improved
by the other necessity of throwing much of it into portraits
of imaginary persons, who are sometimes no doubt very
close copies of real ones. But it contains some open and undisguised
judgments of the great writers of the past, and a number
of astonishingly original, pregnant, and monumentally phrased
observations of a general character. In fact I should not hesitate
to say that La Bruyère is, after Dryden, who had preceded
him by twenty years, the first very great man of letters in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>modern times who gave himself to Criticism with a comparatively
unshackled mind, and who has put matter of permanent
value in her treasuries without being a professional rhetorician
or commentator. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>General observations.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> We need not dwell on the famous overture
<span lang="fr"><i>Tout est dit</i></span>, for it is merely a brilliant example of the kind of
paradox-shell or rocket, half truth, half falsehood, which a
writer of the kind explodes at the beginning of his entertainment,
to attract the attention of his readers, and let
them see the brilliancy of the stars that drop from
it. But how astonishing is it, in the 17th section, to find, two
hundred years and more ago, the full Flaubertian doctrine of
the “single word” laid down with confidence, and without an
apparent sense that the writer is saying anything new!<a id='r383'></a><a href='#f383' class='c019'><sup>[383]</sup></a> No
matter that soon after, in 20, we find an old fallacy, ever
new, put in the words, “<span lang="fr">Le plaisir de la critique nous ôte celui
d'être vivement touchés de très-belles choses.</span>” If criticism does
this it is the wrong criticism—the criticism <span lang="fr"><i>à la</i></span> Boileau, and not
the criticism after the manner of Longinus. A man may have
spent a lifetime in reading “overthwart and endlong” (as the
<span lang="fr"><cite>Morte d’Arthur</cite></span> says) in every direction of literature, in reading
always critically, and in reading for long years as professional
reviewer, and yet feel as keenly as ever the literary charm
which age cannot wither nor custom stale,—the “strong
pleasure” of the beautiful word.</p>

<p class='c000'>But how well he recovers himself, among other things, with
the remarks on the <cite>Cid</cite>, and the difference between the fine and
the faultless at 30! with the declaration of independence immediately
following in 31, and practically drawing a cancel through
the whole critical teaching of Boileau! “<span lang="fr">Quand une lecture
vous élève l’esprit, ... ne cherchez pas une autre règle pour
juger; il est bon.</span>” How delicate his remarks in 37 on the
delicacy of touch, the illogical but impeccable concatenation,
the justice of phrase, of the best feminine writing! Not a few
of his observations are paraphrases or, as it were, echoes of
Longinus himself, whom he has assimilated as Longinus’ translator
never could have done. And if some further remarks on
criticism in 63 seem to regard rather the abuse than the nature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>of the art—if the famous “<span lang="fr">Un homme né Chrétien et Français
se trouve contraint dans la satire; les grands sujets lui
sont défendus,</span>” is half a political grumble and half a paralogism,
which was to be accepted with fatal results in the next century—both
this and other things are redeemed throughout by the
general independence and freshness of the judgment, the vigour
and decision of the phrase. In the judgments of authors above
referred to (which begin at 38 and continue for some eight or
nine numbers, to be resumed with special reference to dramatists
and dramas a little later), it is especially possible to appreciate
La Bruyère’s idiosyncrasy as a critic, the vivacity and
power of his natural endowments in this direction, and his
drawback, arising partly from sheer acceptance of prevailing
opinion, and partly from the fact that he is merely coasting the
subject on his way to others.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the joint or contrasted judgment of Terence and Molière
the modern man, according to his kind, may find something
either to laugh or to be irritated at. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Judgments of authors.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Some would as
soon think of comparing the dribbling tap of a jar
of distilled water to the Falls of Schaffhausen. But La Bruyère
practically shows himself as conscious of the truth as his time
would let him be when, allowing Terence purity, exactness to
rule, polish, elegance, character (<i>i.e.</i>, type-character), he ruins all
by admitting that “<span lang="fr">il n’a manqué à lui que d'être moins froid.</span>”
And if (as many did then, and some do now) he takes that
wrong view of style and language which permits them to accuse
Molière of “jargon,” of barbarism, he gives him fire, naïveté, a
fount of real pleasantry, exact representation (“imitation”) of
manners, imagery, and “the scourge of ridicule.” “What a
man,” he says, “you could have made of these two!” though
how you can join fire and <span lang="fr"><i>froid</i></span>, and what would have been left
of Terence’s old-maidish neatness when joined to such a husband,
Heaven and Apollo only know! But we can see very well that
La Bruyère admires Molière because he does admire him, and
Terence because he is told to do so.</p>

<p class='c000'>The conjunction, even in contrast, of Malherbe and Théophile
has puzzled some folk; but, as M. Servois points out, it is a
mere matter of chronology, and Boileau had done it before.
And it is very noteworthy that La Bruyère does not bear hardly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>on Théophile. The remark that Marot seems more modern than
Ronsard is perfectly well founded. And if there is some oddity
in his surprise that Marot, “natural and easy as he is, did not
make of Ronsard, so full of <em>verve</em> and fire, a poet better than
either of them actually is,” it is much less odd, and much more
acute, than it looks at first sight. The judgment of Rabelais,
a famous one, if not wholly wide-eyed, keeps its eyes singularly
wide open for so artificial an age: and there is a whole volume
in the double defence of Montaigne against opposite criticisms,
to the effect that he is too full of thought for some men, and too
natural in his mode of thinking for others.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is by no means certain that the unnamed author aimed at
in 52 is Molière, and the most fervent of “Cornelians” can
hardly quarrel with the judgment that Corneille is unequalled
where he is good, but more often unequal to himself. La
Bruyère seems, though rather furtively, to set the awful
Unities at nought in this great dramatist’s favour; and he is
both just and happy in praising the variety of Corneille as
compared to the monotony of Racine. The whole article, which
is a long one, is distinctly on the Cornelian side, though far
from unjust to Racine; and one can well understand the disconcerting
effect which it seems to have produced on Voltaire.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the whole, the only reasons for not ranking La Bruyère’s
criticism very high indeed are that there is so little of it, and
that it is obviously the work of a man to whom it is more
a casual pastime than a business—who has not thought himself
out all along the line in it, but has emitted a few observations.
Still, those which express his deliberate opinions are almost
always sound, and only some of those which he has adopted
without examination are wholly or partially false.</p>

<p class='c000'>The critical utterances of Fénelon<a id='r384'></a><a href='#f384' class='c019'><sup>[384]</sup></a> are much more voluminous,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>though in part, at least, not quite so disinterested, and they are
of a very high critical interest and value. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Fénelon. The</i> <span lang="fr">Dialogues sur l’Eloquence.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> They are
contained in two documents, the <span lang="fr"><cite>Dialogues sur l’Eloquence</cite></span>
(which, though not known, is believed to be a
work of his early manhood, but was only published
after his death by the Chevalier Ramsay) and one of his very
latest pieces, the <span lang="fr"><cite>Mémoire sur les Occupations de l’Académie
Française</cite></span>, sent in, to obey a resolution of that body, in November
1713, with the much longer explanatory letter of the next
year thereon to Dacier.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first is conditioned—unfavourably it may seem for our
purpose—by its avowed limitation to <em>sacred</em> eloquence. A
young aspirant to the cloth has fallen in love with a fashionable
preacher, wishes a cooler friend to share his enthusiasm,
and, being rebuffed, elicits from that friend by degrees a
complete criticism of the rhetoric of the pulpit, and the rules
that should govern it. Since we have found discussions, even
of profane oratory, surprisingly barren in pure literary criticism
of old, this of sacred may seem still less promising. But though
Fénelon’s interest in the soul-curing part of the matter is constant
and intense, he does not allow it either to obscure or
to adulterate his literary censure. At first, in particular, the
arguments of his “A” (the critical friend who, no doubt,
is Fénelon himself) not merely have nothing more to do with
the pulpit than with the bar or the Senate, but have little if
anything more to do with spoken than with written literature.
The disdainful description (at p. 5 <i>ed. cit.</i>) of that epigrammatic
or enigmatic style, which is always with us, as <span lang="fr"><i>des tours de
passe-passe</i></span>; the excellent passage (ibid., 7-9) on Demosthenes,
Isocrates, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, and Longinus himself—on
whom Fénelon speaks with far more appreciation than
Boileau, and probably with more knowledge than Dryden;
the bold attitude taken up at p. 18 on the question of the
perfect hero; the exaltation (perhaps the most noteworthy
thing in the whole) of “painting,” of bringing the visual image
home to the reader, at p. 35; the scorn of mere verbal fault-finding
at p. 47; the ardent panegyric of the literary greatness
of the Bible at p. 69; and of the Fathers at p. 86 <i>sq.</i>—all these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>passages, which are almost pure gold of criticism, have nothing
special to do with the mere <span lang="fr"><i>métier</i></span> of the preacher. That
Fénelon was neither perfect nor wholly beyond his time is
quite true. He has here a deplorable assault on Gothic
Architecture (which he repeats at greater length in the
Academic letter, and for which, if he had not been so good
and great a man, one could wish the stones of his cathedral to
have fallen upon him), and his contempt extends to mediæval
literature. But the same doom is on the best of archbishops
and the most beautiful of girls: they can but give what they
have.</p>

<p class='c000'>And Fénelon gives very much. The Memoir and Letter
above referred to were elicited by a demand on Academicians
for proposals in regard to the reorganising of the work
of the <a id='corr306.15'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Acadeny'>Academy</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_306.15'><ins class='correction' title='Acadeny'>Academy</ins></a></span>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span lang="fr">Sur les Occupations de l’Académie Française.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Here, therefore, as in the other
case, the immediate purpose is special; but the
general literary interests of the critic again prevent
it from being specialised in the dismal and deadly modern
sense. He does not fail to deal with the daily dreadful line of
the Dictionary; but he proposes, as supplements, divers things—a
new <cite>Poetic</cite>, a new <cite>Rhetoric</cite>, Chrestomathies from the Ancients
on both heads (things needed to this day), and above all, a complete
Academic edition of the great classics of France, with
really critical introduction and annotations, or at least a corpus
of critical observations on them.</p>

<p class='c000'>But, as usual, it is in the incidental remarks that the value
of the piece lies; and these make it, I do not hesitate to say,
the most valuable single piece of criticism that France had yet
produced. Fénelon shows his acquaintance with other modern
languages; and pays a particular compliment to Prior, who, it
must be remembered, was about this time occupying his rather
uneasy post of Ambassador. He may be too hasty in saying
that the Italians and Spaniards will perhaps never make good
tragedies or epigrams, nor the French good epics and sonnets,
as he most certainly is too ignorant in saying that “after our
ancient poets” [a very few, mostly undistinguished persons,
in the latter part of the sixteenth century] had tried classical
metres and failed, “we” [the French of course] “had to invent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>measures suitable to our words.” But he is astonishingly bold
in his recurrence to Pléiade principles, and in actually urging
English as a good example on the point of taking from neighbours
any word found convenient. He says plumply “<span lang="fr">de telles
usurpations <em>sont permises</em></span>” (p. 103 <i>ed. cit.</i>) Alas! in England
itself, and after two centuries, one uses this just liberty at
personal risk. His Rhetoric section partly repeats the <cite>Dialogues</cite>,
and is altogether more technical or professional than
literary. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>And its challenge to correctness.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But his Poetical section is full of interest. It is
marred by that not quite single-minded fancy for
prose poetry which has already been glanced at, and
to which we shall have to return. But the attack
on rhyme is partly excused, and the, at first sight, bewildering
remark (p. 123) that “rhyme is of itself more difficult than all
the rules of Greek and Latin prosody” is rendered intelligible,
by a remembrance of the extremely arbitrary rules which had
by this time been imposed on the French rhymer. The paragraph
on Ronsard,<a id='r385'></a><a href='#f385' class='c019'><sup>[385]</sup></a> the best known piece of the whole, is admirable
in its tempering of sympathy with censure; and the
acknowledgment of the “opposite extreme” into which French
for more than a century had fallen,<a id='r386'></a><a href='#f386' class='c019'><sup>[386]</sup></a> is one of the great epoch-making
sentences of criticism. Of course it was not attended
to; but for a hundred years and more French literature bore
ever-increasing testimony to its truth.</p>

<p class='c000'>The censure of French drama is injured, partly by certain
prejudices of the moralist and the theologian, and partly by
less accountable crotchets. On Molière in particular, though
he cannot help admiring the greatest of his contemporary
countrymen, he is something from which we had best turn our
faces, putting likewise into the wallet at our backs (and Time’s)
the complaints of <span lang="fr"><i>la basse plaisanterie de Plaute</i></span>, and the statement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>that <span lang="fr"><i>on se passe volontiers d’Aristophane</i></span>. The point is the
quantity of opinion which is not for Oblivion’s alms-bag. And,
abundant as this is in Fénelon, the quality of it is more remarkable
even than the quantity. He always prefers the
study of author, and book, and piece, and phrase, to the study
of Kind and the manufacture of Rule. Though he is in no
sense an Anarchist, and may even have sometimes his cloth
rather too much in his remembrance, yet he remembers likewise,
and transfers to profane things, the sacred precept, “Prove
all things: hold fast that which is good.” The fatal fault of
the extremest kind of neo-classic criticism—the weak point in
all of it—is the usual refusal to “prove” the work, even to see
whether it is good or not, if it fails to answer at first blush to
certain arbitrary specifications. Fénelon is free from this:
he has escaped from the House of Bondage.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have for some time been occupied with the critical work
of great men of letters; we must now turn to that of four men
who, if they had not been critics, would hardly have been
heard of in their own day, and would certainly not be remembered
by posterity out of their own country—or perhaps in
it. As it was, all the four exercised immense influence, not
merely in France but elsewhere, and three of them saw their
work promptly translated into English, and received with
almost touching deference in the country which had Dryden
to look to for criticism, nay, by Dryden himself. The order
in which we may take them shall be determined by that of the
appearance of their principal critical works. The <span lang="fr"><cite>Pratique du
Théâtre</cite></span> of François Hédelin, Abbé d’Aubignac, appeared in 1657;
the first <span lang="fr"><cite>Réflexions</cite></span> of Rapin in 1668; the <span lang="fr"><cite>Entretiens d’Ariste</cite></span>
of Bouhours in 1671; and the <span lang="fr"><cite>Traité du Poème Epique</cite></span> of Le
Bossu in 1675. All four, it is to be observed, were clerics of
one sort or another, while Rapin and Bouhours were schoolmasters,
and Hédelin was at least a private tutor. Taken
together, they exhibit the hand-book and school-book side of
the criticism of which Boileau is the contemporary satiric
expositor to the world; and their criticism cannot properly be
dissociated from his. As dates sufficiently show, they do not
in any sense derive from him; nor, to do him justice, does
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>he from them. The whole quintet, with others of less importance,
are all the more valuable exponents of the strong
contemporary set of the tide in the direction of hard-and-fast
“classical” legislation for literature.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is among the few and peculiar laurels of the Abbé
D’Aubignac to have failed in more kinds of literature than
most men try. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Abbé D’Aubignac.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> His tragedy of <span lang="fr"><cite>Zénobie</cite></span> (1647) was
the occasion of a well-known epigram from the great
Condé, which is not the less good for its obviousness, and which,
with equal ease and justice,<a id='r387'></a><a href='#f387' class='c019'><sup>[387]</sup></a> can be adjusted to his criticism.
He is more of an Aristotelian “know-nothing” than La Mesnardière,
and has very much less talent. Not content with the
<span lang="fr"><cite>Pratique</cite></span> (which, as has been said, was really a belated contribution
to the cabal against Corneille), he attacked two of the
great tragedian’s later plays, <span lang="fr"><cite>Sophonisbe</cite></span> and <span lang="fr"><cite>Sertorius</cite></span>, in his
<span lang="fr"><cite>Dissertations en forme de Remarques</cite></span> (1663), and he had many
years earlier attempted to justify Terence against the strictures
of Ménage. The historian of criticism would have been grateful
to him had he confined himself to writing tractates “On the
nature of Satyrs, Brutes, Monsters, and Demons,”<a id='r388'></a><a href='#f388' class='c019'><sup>[388]</sup></a> <span lang="fr"><cite>Relations du
Royaume de Coquetterie</cite></span>, and novels like the rather well-named
<span lang="fr"><cite>Macarise</cite></span>, or <cite>the Queen of the Fortunate Isles</cite>. For these we could
simply have neglected.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <span lang="fr"><cite>Pratique</cite></span>, unfortunately, we cannot neglect wholly, because
of its position as a symptom and an influence. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His</i> <span lang="fr">Pratique du Théâtre.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In reading
it,<a id='r389'></a><a href='#f389' class='c019'><sup>[389]</sup></a> the generous mind oscillates between a sense
of intolerable boredom, and a certain ruth at the
obviously honest purpose and industry that underlie the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>heaps of misapplied learning, and season the gabble of foolish
authority-citing. He begins by a demonstration that all great
statesmen have always patronised stately games, of which
scenic representation is one. Vulgar minds have nothing to
do with it (this was a slap at Castelvetro and his horrible
doctrine of pleasing the multitude, which is a real <span lang="la"><i>lethalis
arundo</i></span> in the sides of all these Frenchmen). He is, we are
rather surprised to hear, <em>not</em> going to theorise. All the theory
has been done, and done once for all, by the ancients. What
he wants to do is to apply this theory to all the practical
contingencies. And this he does through Unities and Episodes,
through Acts and Scenes, through Narration, Discourse, Deliberation,
everything, with sleuth-hound patience on his own
part, and requiring Job’s variety on that of his readers. He is
sometimes quite fair even to Corneille, he seems to be quite
well-meaning; but he cannot help his nativity of dulness, and
at his very best he is a critic of dramaturgy, not of drama.</p>

<p class='c000'>René Rapin, hardly as one sometimes feels inclined to think
and speak of him, was a person of an entirely different order.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Rapin.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In fact, it is very much more on isolated and particular
points than on generals that he lays himself
open to reproach, though it may be retorted that the generals,
which lead logically (as they usually do) to such absurd particulars,
are thereby utterly condemned themselves. It was
specially unfortunate for Rapin that his principles and precepts
were at once caught up in England by a man like Rymer,<a id='r390'></a><a href='#f390' class='c019'><sup>[390]</sup></a> and
expounded in coarse and blunted form to a people still green
and unknowing in critical matters. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His method partly good.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> There is even much in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>method which deserves high praise. It is very noteworthy
that, before he presumed to draw up (or at least to give to the
world) his <span lang="fr"><cite>Réflexions</cite></span> on the <span lang="fr"><cite>Poetics</cite></span> and on Poetry, on Eloquence,
on History, and on Philosophy, he had preluded by elaborate
examinations of the actual documents in the shape of “Comparisons”—“Of
Homer and Virgil,” “Of Cicero and Demosthenes,”
“Of Thucydides and Livy,” “Of Plato and Aristotle.”
And though this sort of “cock-fight comparison” (as
the more vernacular writers of his own time in
English might have said) is “muchwhat” (as his translator
Rymer actually does say) of a mistake, unless pursued with the
greatest possible care—though it was already hackneyed in itself
and constantly in need of extending, supplementing, blending—yet
it is at any rate infinitely superior to the examination <span lang="la"><i>in
vacuo</i></span>, the rattling of dry bones and abstract kinds and qualities,
to which too many of his contemporaries confined themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>Unfortunately Rapin himself was always, consciously or unconsciously,
tending towards this other method; and even in
his comparisons—much more in the extended survey
of ancient and modern writers which he subjoins to
the <span lang="fr"><cite>Réflexions</cite></span>—he is still more constantly seduced by
that labelling criticism which we have traced long
ago to the “canonising” way of the Alexandrians, and for which
we have said hard things of Fronto and others. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His particular absurdities as to Homer in blame.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Yet further,
both his general style of criticism, and his prepossessions of this
or that kind, constantly draw him into pitfalls only less absurd
than those in which Rymer himself wallows. I do not remember
that Rapin ever lays it down that a hero must not be a black
man; probably the French had not been afflicted—for I suppose
they did not make Syphax black—with any poet daring enough
to start the question. But he does other things which, though
less conspicuously, are quite as really silly. In the moral
section<a id='r391'></a><a href='#f391' class='c019'><sup>[391]</sup></a> of his comparison between Homer and Virgil he has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>too much of the Jesuit schoolmaster, with his reverence towards
boys, to mention that terrible scene between Zeus and Hera
which had already distressed the compatriots of Aristophanes
and Martial, and which remains one of the earliest examples of
absolutely perfect poetry in a particular kind. But he makes
up for it. We have, of course, the “wine-heavy, dog-eyed, hare-hearted”
line to mourn over. How undignified of Homer to make
Achilles anxious about the preservation of the body of Patroclus
from corruption! How could Ulysses, with such an excellent
wife and such an amiable son, waste time with Calypso and
dangle after Circe, to whom the pudibund Rapin applies
epithets which <em>our</em> Decorum prevents us from repeating, and
for which he deserved to be both shipwrecked and turned into a
Gryll. Was it quite nice of Priam, as a father, to wish all his
children dead so Hector were alive? Nausicaa is too shocking.
A Princess’s face should <em>not</em> show grace, the Jesuit thinks,<a id='r392'></a><a href='#f392' class='c019'><sup>[392]</sup></a>
to men in Ulysses’ condition.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whereas with Virgil it is quite different. Everybody, including
the Gods, behaves “like persons of Quality.” <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>As to Virgil in praise.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Even in
the case of <span lang="la"><cite>Dido dux et Trojanus</cite></span> there is no violation
of modesty,<a id='r393'></a><a href='#f393' class='c019'><sup>[393]</sup></a> which certainly seems either a little
Escobarish towards them, or a little severe to Circe and
Calypso. Indeed, we sometimes find ourselves rather lost with
Rapin’s morality. For, in another passage (Chap. XIII.), he
actually discovers <span lang="fr"><i>un artifice des plus délicats et des plus fins</i></span>
in Virgil’s taking away Dido’s character, though History had
made her a Lady of very good repute.<a id='r394'></a><a href='#f394' class='c019'><sup>[394]</sup></a> For he did it to bring
into contempt the Carthaginians who were afterwards to become
odious to Rome. “A nice marality!” indeed, as my Lord
Foppington observed of another matter, not so very long after
Rapin wrote this.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>Yet even here it is fair to observe that Rapin is at least
trying to make the two ends of his “reason” and his
“reflection” meet: and so it is always:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“His reason rooted in unreason stands,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sense insensate makes him idly wise.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>The consequences are patent on every page, and a chapter
might be not disagreeably filled with them. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>As to others.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Pegasus is admirable,
but the Hippogriff is the vain imagination of
a sick brain: Camilla touching, but Bradamante
absurd. Achilles retires from the Grecian army because he is
discontented; Æneas goes to Italy because he is pious; and
Medea kills her children because she is revengeful—a passage
in which it is agreeable to perceive the obvious first draught of
“I love my love with an A.” As for the moderns, Du Bartas
and Ronsard had all the genius their age was capable of—a
text for a sermon as long as this Book. “Scarce aught can be
understood” of the <cite>Agamemnon</cite>! In fact, quotations<a id='r395'></a><a href='#f395' class='c019'><sup>[395]</sup></a> simply
leap to the eye as one reads the page.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is more important, if less amusing, to inquire how a man,
obviously of much ability, extremely well informed, freer, it
would seem, from mere prejudice than most of his
fellows, came in this way to be constantly stumbling
over blocks that the veriest blockhead might, one would think,
have avoided, and running against blank walls, of which a
blind man might, it should seem, have been aware. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The reading of his riddle.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Rapin is,
perhaps, the main and appointed Helot of the neo-classic
system. That system, instead of assembling all the great works
of literary art, and giving an impartial hearing to each, takes
one or two ancient treatises, themselves necessarily based upon
but a partial examination, spins out of them a universal code,
fills in that code, where it is wanting, with analogies and with
perilous makeshifts of “decorum,” uniformity, and the like, and
then proceeds to apply the result back to the actual works of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>art. It is no wonder that, even of the ancient division of these,
hardly one escapes scot-free, except those which were originally
composed by men of great, but not the greatest, genius, on a
somewhat similar scheme. Elsewhere the unfortunate critic is
constantly catching himself in those bushes which he has
himself planted, and bruising himself against obstacles which
he has elaborately set up. In a general way he grants that
Homer is the greatest of poets; but the Fetiches of “Design”
and “Decorum” extort from him the sacrifice of this in detail,
and the acknowledgment that Homer is frequently most
indecorous, and that large parts of him are out of drawing.
And so of all.</p>

<p class='c000'>Le Bossu (to whom the English sometimes give a superfluous
final <i>t</i>, whom they generally defraud of his rightful “Le,” and
whom in the main they know only from the <span lang="la"><i>locus
classicus</i></span> of Sterne)<a id='r396'></a><a href='#f396' class='c019'><sup>[396]</sup></a> reapproximates to the Aubignacian
level. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Le Bossu and the Abstract Epic.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But it is fair to say that his dulness
arises from a different cause. He is not, like Hédelin, a stupid
man—he is distinctly the reverse—nor is he spiteful. He is
merely the hardiest and most thoroughgoing devotee of a
certain kind of abstract criticism. He does, of course, give us
chapters on some actual illustrations of Heroic or Epic; but
they are scarcely more necessary to his book than the picture-illuminations
of a poem or a novel. Being a writer of some
<span lang="fr"><i>esprit</i></span>, he sometimes exercises it in rather dangerous fictions—for
instance, his imagined epic of Meridarpax, where all the
mouse-stories (mouse and lion, town and country mouse, &#38;c.)
are worked in, would be most sprightly, if it did not look
sprightlier still as an exercise in laughing at his own side.
But by far the greater bulk, and the whole vertebration and
solid substance, of his argument are devoted to Epic in the
Abstract. Design, definition, and parts; good fables and bad
fables; episodes; the biology, so to speak, of the Action, the
narration, the manners and characters, not forgetting the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>Machines, and at last something on the Thoughts and Expression—which
have about one-ninth of the whole. In short, if
we have not exactly Epic <span lang="la"><i>in vacuo</i></span>, we have it as a dried preparation.
The complexity, anti-sensuousness, and dispassionate
character of it are almost abashing; one feels at the end that,
to hanker after an actual poem, be it <cite>Iliad</cite> or <cite>Orlando</cite>, has
something sinful—something of the lust of the flesh.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have said that Le Bossu is rather a sprightly person of a
hyper-scholastic kind. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Bouhours.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> His brother Father, Bouhours, is still
more so; indeed, his famous inquiry, “<span lang="fr">Si un Allemand
peut-être bel-esprit?</span>”<a id='r397'></a><a href='#f397' class='c019'><sup>[397]</sup></a> has got him rather
into trouble with a prevailing party, in and out of Germany.
Beginning with the <span lang="fr"><cite>Entretiens d’Ariste et d’Eugène</cite></span> (1671), a
collection of chiefly verbal criticism on French writers, he continued
it with other works in <span lang="fr"><i>belles lettres</i></span> and theology, the
most important of which, to us, is <span lang="fr"><cite>La Manière de Bien Penser
dans les Ouvrages d’Esprit</cite></span> (1687).<a id='r398'></a><a href='#f398' class='c019'><sup>[398]</sup></a> The book, which is not
short, consists of four Dialogues between Eudoxe and Philanthe,
“<span lang="fr">deux hommes de lettres</span> (as the author remarks in a phrase
to which Time has given a piquant new meaning) <span lang="fr"><em>que la science
n’a point gâtés</em></span>.” Eudoxe, as the name indicates, is the author’s
mouthpiece—a judicious admirer of the Ancients, who can yet
tolerate such moderns as Voiture. Philanthe (also a speaking
name) is a partisan of florid modernity, who is, however, so
little of a “stalwart” that he gives up Ariosto, and intrenches
himself behind Tasso and Lope. In the First dialogue Eudoxe
censures (with abundant citation, as throughout the book) Equivoques,
Hyperboles, <span lang="fr"><i>pointes</i></span>, <span lang="it"><i>concetti</i></span>, and, generally, thoughts
that are “not <em>true</em>.” The Second and Third, starting from
Longinus and Hermogenes, discuss the true and the false in
Sublimity and Wit: and the Fourth is mainly devoted to
Obscurity. Bouhours (whose influence on subsequent critics,
especially on Addison, was very great) writes agreeably, is free
from rudeness and pedantry, and is altogether rather a favourable
example of the school of Good Sense, <span lang="fr"><i>quand même</i></span>. But,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>as favourable examples of bad schools generally do, he damages
his cause more than less favourable ones, because its drawbacks
are more obvious and intrinsic. On his principles you must
ostracise the best, the noblest, the most charming, the most
<cite>poetic</cite> things in poetry. <span lang="fr"><i>Et c’est tout dire.</i></span></p>

<p class='c000'>As we approach the close of the chapter, we come upon classes
and masses of work which is at once impossible to examine
in particular and, as a whole, elusive. In <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Encyclopædias and Newspapers.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> 1687
appeared the <span lang="fr"><cite>Jugements des Savants</cite></span><a id='r399'></a><a href='#f399' class='c019'><sup>[399]</sup></a> of Baillet, and
ten years later the still more famous <span lang="fr"><cite>Dictionnaire
Historique et Critique</cite></span> of Bayle, who had preluded it, from a
time antecedent to that of Baillet’s publication, by <span lang="fr"><cite>Nouvelles de
la République de Lettres</cite></span>, a regular literary review. Long before
this latter the <span lang="fr"><cite>Journal des Savants</cite></span><a id='r400'></a><a href='#f400' class='c019'><sup>[400]</sup></a> and the <span lang="fr"><cite>Mercure Galant</cite></span><a id='r401'></a><a href='#f401' class='c019'><sup>[401]</sup></a>
in France had provided criticism, good, bad, and indifferent,
with regular outlets for itself. And in both kinds—that of the
dictionary or encyclopædia, and that of the periodical—the flood
has never ceased, but has always increased since. Fortunately
for us the impossibility of treating all this is compensated by
the fact that such treatment, if possible, would be superfluous.
But of Bayle and Baillet at least something must be said particularly,
and something also of a remarkable and much less
known continuator of the latter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bayle perhaps needed nothing but better taste, greater freedom
from prejudice, and a more exclusive bent towards purely
literary criticism, to be one of the great literary
critics of the world. <span class='sni side4'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Bayle.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But, unluckily for himself,
he had contracted, through corrupt following doubtless of the
Latins (even such respectable persons as Pliny) and of the
scholars of the Renaissance, a sort of perpetual itch and hankering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>after the indecent, which, to say nothing else, is as
teasing and as tedious in the long-run as an itch for sermonising
and a hankering after instruction. Equally tedious, and in
much worse taste, is the perpetual undercurrent—not seldom
becoming a very obvious top-flood—of sceptical girding and
nagging at the Bible and at religion generally. In both these
respects Bayle was followed by Voltaire. But Voltaire, though
his own literary sympathies were perhaps not his strongest, had
some. Of purely literary sympathies Bayle seldom shows much
trace—by which it is not in the least meant that he is not a
man of letters himself, for he is an excellent one, and the
reproaches which have been addressed to his style are not of
much importance. But it is not literature that he really loves:
it is “philosophy” of a kind, and gossip of almost all kinds.
His wits are always bright and alert, and his learning, though
associated with so many qualities opposed to those of the mere
pedant, and not impeccable, is pretty sound. He has the curiosity,
the acuteness, the erudition, the industry of the true critic,
but he has neither the enthusiasm, nor the disinterestedness,
nor the grasp.</p>

<p class='c000'>In both these respects, as in others, Baillet is very much a
diminutive of him. <span class='sni side4'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Baillet.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In fact, brightness of wit has almost disappeared;
and though Ménage—himself no infallible
guide—has been both ill-mannered and hypercritical
in the strictures of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Anti-Baillet</cite></span>, there is no doubt that
the <span lang="fr"><cite>Jugements des Savants</cite></span> is a book not to be used without
verification on particular points. But this is almost a property,
or, at worst, an inseparable accident, of these <span lang="fr"><cite>Collectanea</cite></span>; and a
fair-minded reader cannot help admiring the extraordinary industry
with which Baillet executed his task, while appreciating
the significance of this record of a division of literature which,
as we saw at the close of the last volume, had, scarcely two
centuries before, the most meagre representation of all.<a id='r402'></a><a href='#f402' class='c019'><sup>[402]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>Curiously enough the want of judgment with which Baillet
has been, and to some extent may justly be, reproached shows
itself exactly in the most unlikely place. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The ethos of a Critical Pedant.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> His opening volume
on the nature, legitimacy, and so forth of Criticism, though too
prolix, collects an extraordinary number of just and valuable
things, and adds to them at least something of the author’s
own. His Character of a Pedantic, Chicaning, Malicious Critic
(partly borrowed from Le Bon, partly elaborated by himself)
will be found at vol. i. p. 52., and has been justified
by some seven generations of the persons it describes.
It is Pedantry “to pick low and little faults, and to
excite yourself over matters which are of no importance.” It is
Pedantry “to steal from an author and insult him at the same
time; to tear outrageously those who differ with you in opinion.”
It is Pedantry “to endeavour to raise the whole world against
some one who does not think enough of Cicero.” It is Pedantry
“to take occasion by an author’s mistake to endeavour to humiliate
him and ruin his reputation.” It is Pedantry “to send
your author back in a haughty manner to the lowest class, and
to menace him with whip and ferule for an error in chronology.”
It is not merely Pedantry but Chicanery “to separate phrases
in order to give them another sense,” to “impute printers’
errors,” to “neglect or change punctuation.” We need not go
on to Baillet’s signs of “Malignity”: the cap is already a good
cap, a very good cap, and one need not go far to find some one
to wear it.</p>

<p class='c000'>A boiling down of this volume—which, so far as I know, has
never been executed—would be far superior to most general
works on the subject with which I am acquainted. Nor is
Baillet’s distribution of his scheme altogether a bad one. It is
in the detailed carrying out (where one would suppose that for
a man of such industry the least part of the difficulty lay) that
he is most unsatisfactory. He neglects—in a manner surprising
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>from one of that still scholastically educated generation of
ecclesiastics, who were wont positively to abuse division and
subdivision—the most obvious and mechanical assistances of
method. His first sketch of subdivisions, though wanting
succinctness, is not ill; but he never really carries it out, and
stuffs in its stead long collections on “Precocious Persons,”
“Authors in Disguise,” and <span lang="fr">“Les <em>Anti</em>”</span> (books of a polemic
character with titles so beginning), which belong only to the
curiosities of Criticism. Further, he never seems to have set
out, in any of the divisions, with a preliminary list of the authors
he meant to handle, so that his omissions and inclusions are
equally surprising. And, lastly, he never seems to have worked
out any preliminary calculus of the amount of space which such
authors as he does admit proportionately deserve. But the
extent of his knowledge is astounding, and the way in which he
communicates it not disagreeable.</p>

<p class='c000'>Baillet’s unmethodical prosecution of his task was in this fortunate
for us that it induced a somewhat younger contemporary,
Balthasar Gibert, to take up the rhetorical-critical
side of his work, and continue it in a book<a id='r403'></a><a href='#f403' class='c019'><sup>[403]</sup></a> not
very much known but of great value. <span class='sni side4'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Gibert.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In strict date it belongs
to the next century, and therefore to the next Book, but we have
always taken, and shall always take, liberty of protracting or
foreshortening our views as may be desirable; and this is
avowedly a supplement to Baillet, though limited in subject,
allowing, in consequence, fuller treatment of individuals, and
displaying a good deal more originality and judgment. Gibert
excellently supplies Baillet’s admitted insufficiency as to Longinus;
he is very copious on Hermogenes, who had been
coming, from Sturm downwards, into more and more estimation;
and if in his accounts of the Italians he shows a traditional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>rather than an adequately comparative estimate,<a id='r404'></a><a href='#f404' class='c019'><sup>[404]</sup></a> he is
sufficiently modern to give a quite considerable abstract of “M.
Mackenze” (<i>sic</i>), <i>i.e.</i>, Sir George Mackenzie’s <span lang="la"><cite>Idea Eloquentiæ
Forensis Hodiernæ</cite></span>. That he “but yaws neither” between
Rhetoric and Criticism is a point of no importance against him;
and it is a valuable document for the gradual transformation
of the one into the other.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have to terminate this chapter, as we shall have to begin
the corresponding one in the next Book, by saying something on
the famous—the much too famous—Battle of the
Ancients and the Moderns; but the space which we
shall give it on both occasions will appear strangely,
and perhaps scandalously, short to some readers. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Ancient and Modern Quarrel.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Neither idleness
nor caprice, however, can be justly charged against the
contraction. In the first place, things generally known may be
justifiably passed with slighter notice in a continuous history,
which has to deal with much that is very little known.
From all sides, and in all ways, the Battle of the Ancients and
Moderns is very well known indeed. It enjoys, and for more
than a generation has enjoyed, the advantage of occupying one
of the best monographs ever written. It engaged, on repeated
occasions, the attention of the best equipped and the most readable
of all French, if not of all, critics—Sainte-Beuve. It was
arranged—not ill if not wholly well—for popular English consumption
by the expert skill of Macaulay. As a result partly
of Swift’s genuine literary sympathies, partly of his more or less
accidental connections, the commentators of one of the greatest
writers not only of England, but of the world, have been driven
to expound it: as have, for more essential reasons, those of
more than two or three great or interesting writers in France—Boileau,
Perrault, Fontenelle, and others. From all this
almost everybody must have learnt something about it, and to
some of all this almost everybody can fairly be referred if he
wishes to learn more.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the matter is not really of so much importance in the
History of Criticism as it may at first sight appear to possess.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Its small critical value.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> These quarrels rarely do much critical good; for the critical
issues are almost always obscured in them, first
by the <span lang="la"><i>animus</i></span> and prejudice of the combatants, and
then by the mere dust of the fighting. But this
particular combat did perhaps the least good of all; and
could have done the least good. It was indeed sufficiently
inevitable: for the sort of deification with which the whole
of the sixteenth century, and most orthodox authority in the
earlier seventeenth, had regarded antiquity, was sure to breed
revolt. But it led to no conclusion; it evolved no truth.
Truth is not the daughter of Ignorance; and it is really hard
to say which party shows most ignorance in this matter. The
defenders of the Ancients knew, as a rule, next to nothing of
the Moderns; and the defenders of the moderns knew a great
deal too little of the ancients. La Motte knew no Greek if
Perrault<a id='r405'></a><a href='#f405' class='c019'><sup>[405]</sup></a> knew any; and with Boileau not only to all appearance
was English literature a blank sheet, but almost the whole
sheet of French literature before his own time was either
blank or inscribed with fantastic fallacies. Still, this is not a
condition entirely or commonly unknown in squabbles of this
kind. The signal distinction and disqualification of the advocates
in this famous cause is that, as a rule, neither any of
the leaders, nor any of the juniors, had taken more than the
slightest trouble to get up, or at least to understand, his <em>own</em>
brief. The Ancients are here in a little better case than the
Moderns; but they were not in so very much better case. Most
of them knew the Latin classics fairly well; and some of them
(though by no means all, or even many) had a fair, while a
few had a good, acquaintance with Greek.<a id='r406'></a><a href='#f406' class='c019'><sup>[406]</sup></a> But, with rarest,
if with any exceptions, they persisted in exaggerating, if not in
contemplating solely, that side of Classical Literature which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>has been and must be admitted to be its principal side, but
which is not the only one. They would not see—or if they
saw, they expressed positive distaste for—the vaguer, more imaginative,
more “Romantic” beauty of Greek, and in a less degree
of Latin. They never dreamt of turning the tables on
their antagonists, as they might have done to no inconsiderable
extent, from this point of view. And by holding up Design,
Order, Decorum, and the rest, as paramount conditions of literary
excellence, they laid themselves open to the most inconvenient
retorts from well-equipped adversaries, and even received
some on the score of Homer, badly as their adversaries
were equipped as a rule.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the other hand, the Moderns were, for the most part, like
men who have Toledos by their sides and choose to fight with
cabbage-plants. The French ignored the English and sneered
at the Italians and Spaniards since the Renaissance, indulging
the while in placid but contemptuous ignorance or misrepresentation
of everything before it out of Italy. The English were
prepared to admit that nobody had achieved sweetness in English
numbers before Mr Waller, apologised (except Dryden and
Dryden only in a few moments) for Shakespeare, and thought
Chaucer a good funny old savage.</p>

<p class='c000'>Out of such a welter of blundering little good could come, and
no good came save one. It is, I believe, absolutely impossible
to trace, in so much as one single filament, the extension and
deepening of critical appreciation which began in the next century
to the Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns. But that
quarrel did excite and feed the critical spirit and appetite, and
did give signs of an as yet half-blind craving for the possession
of critical knowledge.<a id='r407'></a><a href='#f407' class='c019'><sup>[407]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c020'>
<div class='footnote' id='f292'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r292'>292</a>. I am not aware of any History of
the subject of this Book as a whole:
nor even of any devoted to French seventeenth-century
Criticism extensively
but exclusively. The nearest thing to
this latter is M. Bourgoin’s excellent
<span lang="fr"><cite>Les Maîtres de la Critique au 17ème
Siècle</cite></span> (Paris, 1889), giving studies of
Malherbe, Chapelain, Saint-Evremond,
Boileau, and La Bruyère. For the inevitable,
though tedious, quarrel of
Ancients and Moderns, H. Rigault’s
book on the subject (Paris, 1859) is,
and is likely to remain, a standard.
Monographs are, of course, innumerable;
and the very large proportionate
space given in the usual French
literary histories to this period, makes
these specially pertinent. Two of the
largest volumes of M. Petit de Julleville’s
book, for instance—with ample
bibliographies—contain the seventeenth
century only.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f293'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r293'>293</a>. Felt rather than acknowledged, it
is true. We by no means uncommonly
find hard words used of Scaliger,
whose Homerophobia shocked orthodox
French critics of this time more than
his Virgiliomania conciliated them.
Yet they owed him almost everything.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f294'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r294'>294</a>. <span lang="fr"><cite>Enfin Malherbe vint.</cite></span> The edition
in the <span lang="fr"><cite>Grands Ecrivains</cite></span>, by M. Ludovic
Lalanne (5 vols., Paris, 1862-69), is not
only by far the best, but in our case
indispensable, as giving the full commentary
on Desportes.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f295'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r295'>295</a>. The <span lang="fr"><cite>Historiette</cite></span> of Tallemant (ed.
Monmerqué, i. 236-278) is apparently
based upon a fuller version of Racan,
and must be compared.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f296'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r296'>296</a>. In the Ninth Satire (<i>v. infra</i>).
Regnier was Desportes’ nephew, and is
said by the anecdotists (see last note)
to have been incensed against Malherbe,
not merely by the latter’s literary opposition
to his uncle, but by a piece of
gross rudeness of Malherbe’s to Desportes
in the latter’s own house, where
Regnier himself had introduced him.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f297'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r297'>297</a>. The French critics, however, have
perhaps taken too literally his reported
blasphemy, that he did not value a
good poet above a good player at ninepins.
Malherbe was a Norman—that
is to say, a parcel-Englishman—and
may well have had something of that
English humour of disparaging his own
matters which is so incomprehensible
to the French.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f298'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r298'>298</a>. The version in Tallemant adds that
he <em>dis</em>liked Virgil. He also scoffed at
the idea of “number” (rhythm) in
prose.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f299'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r299'>299</a>. Ed. Lalanne, iv. 249-473. There
is an elaborate and standard monograph
on this by M. Brunot, <span lang="fr"><cite>La
Doctrine de Malherbe</cite></span> (Paris, 1891);
but, as in other cases, I am obliged to
postpone the comment to the text.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f300'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r300'>300</a>. There are things of Castelvetro’s in
the <span lang="fr"><cite>Opere Varie</cite></span> not wholly dissimilar;
but these were then unpublished.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f301'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r301'>301</a>. I have sometimes wondered whether
the fact that, according to the Racan-Tallemant
anecdote, Malherbe only
“struck through” his copy of Ronsard
without annotating it, is not an involuntary
testimony to the Prince of
Poets. Malherbe, for all his rancour
and narrowness, was no fool; and he
must in his mind have anticipated a
famous later sentence about the eagle
floating</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Beyond the arrows, shouts, and views of men.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Desportes is not exactly an eagle, and
Malherbe has better game with him,
but still not the best of the game.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f302'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r302'>302</a>. Not to be confounded with the critic
and versifier, René Rapin, who was not
born till after Regnier’s death, and
whom to call “favourite, &#38;c.,” would
indeed have been a dreadful thing
to do; still less with the historian
Rapin de Thoyras, who was a generation
later again. This Rapin was
Nicolas, part author of the glorious
<span lang="fr"><cite>Satire Menippée</cite></span>, victor in the burlesque
contest of the Flea (see Southey’s
<cite>Doctor</cite>), a good versifier in Latin, and
no ill one in French, though he was
of the (in France not very numerous)
partisans of classical metres. He died
in 1608, not long after the date of this
satire.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f303'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r303'>303</a>. I read my Regnier in two editions,
both very desirable as books, and of
different merits otherwise. The one,
that of Prosper Poitevin (Paris, 1860),
is very compact; and, besides other
matter, has the old commentary of
Brossette, which is extremely interesting
as expressing the views of a
disciple of Boileau on a poet whom, to
do him justice, Boileau could not but
admire, though he characteristically
belittled him. The other, that of E.
Courbet (Paris, 1875), has a text adjusted
in the scrupulous modern manner,
and some important additions to
the biography.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f304'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r304'>304</a>. For instance, the <em>yoking</em> of Virgil,
Tasso, and Ronsard. This Pisgah-sight
of literature was what the
Renaissance, and the whole neo-classic
period, almost invariably failed to
attain.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f305'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r305'>305</a>. There was, however, a remnant.
Even Balzac called him “<span lang="fr">Le tyran
des mots et des syllabes;</span>” even
Chapelain recognised (acutely enough)
the fact that his methods were
rhetorical rather than poetical; even
Tallemant practically summed him up,
once and for all, in the words, “<span lang="fr">Il n’avait
pas beaucoup de génie: la méditation
et l’art l’ont fait poëte.</span>” But
the majority and the hour were with
him.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f306'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r306'>306</a>. Those who wish for something
more on this subject, without attacking
Vaugelas for themselves, may be
strongly recommended to the full and
excellent article of M. Brunot in Petit
de Julleville (vi. 674-690), one of the
very best papers in the book.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f307'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r307'>307</a>. He is often called this, but not
quite fairly, for he was born in Bresse.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f308'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r308'>308</a>. For other grammarian-rhetoricians
of 1610-1660 see M. Brunot as above.
On the <span lang="fr"><cite>Art Poétique</cite></span> of P. de Deimier
(1610), compare  also Rücktaschel
<i>ubi sup.</i></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f309'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r309'>309</a>. He was born in Angoulême.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f310'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r310'>310</a>. Pp. 509-689 of the second of two
stately folios (Paris, 1665). The <cite>Letters</cite>
are in the first.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f311'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r311'>311</a>. Balzac himself rather mincingly
deprecates this word. <span lang="fr">“Je ne donne”</span>
he says to Chapelain (XX. 25) <span lang="fr">“jamais
de jugement; mais je dis quelquefois
mon avis.”</span></p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f312'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r312'>312</a>. With this it is interesting to
compare the disquisition written to
Balzac, and apparently at his request,
<span lang="la"><cite>De Ludicra Dictione</cite></span> (opening his
<span lang="fr"><cite>Opera</cite></span>, fol., Amst., 1709) by François
Vavasseur, a Jesuit Professor, who also
wrote not a bad book on <cite>Epigrams</cite> and
some other literary work, besides sermons
and theological treatises. Vavasseur
is at once refreshingly logical and
audacious. The Greeks (he is bold
enough even to face the retort of
“Aristophanes”?) did not use <span lang="la"><i>ludicra
dictio</i></span> or burlesque language. Nor
did the Romans: for Lucilius <span lang="la"><i>desideratur</i></span>
(scarcely so much as to warrant
the conclusion to those who know the
fragments well), and as for Petronius
and Apuleius, decent people never mention
<em>them</em>. Secondly, the ancient critics
give no precepts for it. Thirdly, there
is no reason for using it. Fourthly,
there are many reasons for <em>not</em> using it.
So that is settled. One may like
Vavasseur.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f313'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r313'>313</a>. Some authorities give <em>this</em> as the
anagram, the other as the name. But
it does not in the least matter.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f314'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r314'>314</a>. The Pleiad tragedies (<i>v. supra</i>, p.
127) had been Senecan, but not quite
“regular”; and though Hardy broke
loose from Time and Place, it was not
always very violently.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f315'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r315'>315</a>. Ogier, like his Italian predecessors,
is firm on the pleasure-giving quality
of dramatic art. His manner is well
illustrated by his remark that the constant
arrival of messengers is more
suitable to a good inn than to a good
tragedy.  One wonders whether he
knew the Spaniards (<i>v. inf.</i> ch. 2).</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f316'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r316'>316</a>. His mother was deeply devoted to
this school, and had in her youth
known Ronsard personally. The gibing
part of the anecdote about the
author of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Pucelle</cite></span> being “bred a
poet” was never very funny, and is
now more than very stale. The historical
part remains and flourishes.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f317'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r317'>317</a>. It is formally the Academy’s and
not his. But there is no real doubt
that nearly all of it expresses his sentiments,
and that much of it is actually
his in language. The whole history of
the <cite>Cid</cite> dispute is minute and complicated,
and may be found in many
books. The persons chiefly responsible
for it, besides Richelieu and Chapelain,
were Georges de Scudéry, an eccentric
failure of a genius, Mairet, a playwright
of talent, and Claveret, one of
none. In all cases, it is to be feared,
the extraordinary success of the piece
was the exciting cause.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f318'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r318'>318</a>. Of course there is much to be said
for them, rightly understood, from the
point of view of mere <em>theatrical</em> arrangement:
while mediocre writers are
more safely to be trusted with than
without them. But we are speaking
of <em>literature</em>, not the theatre; and in
literature the weak brother is rather a
nuisance to be extirpated, than a person
to be provided for, or conceded to.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f319'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r319'>319</a>. M. Jules Lemaître’s article on the
subject in Petit de Julleville (iv. 273
<i>sq.</i>) most ingenuously cites the virtuous
authority of M. Dumas <span lang="fr"><i>fils</i></span> in support
of Chapelain, and is not far from opining
in the same sense. It is always
difficult for a Frenchman to pardon
an honest love. If Chimène had been
married and Rodrigue her gallant, it
would have been quite different. She
might have overlooked the blood of
20,000 fathers.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r331'>331</a>. Scudéry thinks Four things necessary
to Epic—the authority of History,
the observance of received Religion,
the exercise of Poetic Licence in
Fiction, and the provision of Great
Events. He is not uninteresting for
his connection with his sister’s prose
Romances in which he had some, if
not much, share, and which he never
forgets. Also, he clings to the Pléiade
technicalities to some extent—kindly,
however, explaining such words as
<span lang="fr"><i>Hune</i></span>, <span lang="fr"><i>Quille</i></span> (which, he says rather
quaintly, is <span lang="fr"><i>un bois courbé qui est au
plus bas d’un vaisseau</i></span>), and <span lang="fr"><i>Calfater</i></span>.
The <cite>Ibrahim</cite> preface, thirteen years
earlier, exhibits the same obliging explanation
of technicalities, and the
same virtuous adherence to The Rules.
“Provided,” he says, “that an Architect
takes his measures right, he is
assured of the beauty of his building,”
which would seem to dissuade any one
from advancing beyond the packing-case
style of architecture. And he is
sure that a Romance, like an Epic,
should never go beyond one year in
time.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r354'>354</a>. On all these, see Tallemant, Bayle,
and others down to Sainte-Beuve. For
a typical literary and critical quarrel,
beginning politely and ending in something
like Billingsgate, nothing can be
better than that battle of Costar and
M. de Girac, first over the dead body
of Voiture and the live one of Balzac,
and then over both these departed,
which Sainte-Beuve tells in his liveliest
manner at pp. 210-231 of the 12th vol.

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f355'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r355'>355</a>. To those who are acquainted with
the most interesting handling of Desmarets
in M. Rigault’s so often cited
book (<span lang="fr"><cite>Querelle des Anc. et Mod.</cite></span>, pp.
80-103), my reference to him may seem
too low and little.  As a matter of
fact, I think rather better of Desmarets
than M. Rigault did. But the latter’s
purpose of enlarging—I do not say
exaggerating—his portraits of everybody
who had to do with the “quarrel”
sometimes, I think, throws them a little
out of proportion, if not of focus, for a
general critical history. His chapter,
however, is excellent, if not quite just;
and it should have by itself sufficed to
save those who will not read originals
from a blunder into which some writers
have fallen—that of crediting Desmarets
with the <em>first</em> vindication of
the Christian epic, and the <em>first</em> denunciation
of heathen mythology as a
poetic stuff. The mere name of Tasso
ought to suffice as a reminder of the
falsity of this; the work of Gambara
(<i>v. supra</i>, p. 107 note), though I cannot
speak of it at first hand, must be got
out of the way by them; and Vauquelin
de la Fresnaye (<i>v. supra</i>, p. 131)
had in France itself made the way plain,
for the author of <span lang="fr"><cite>Clovis</cite></span>. But he certainly
drew a good bow in this not too
happy battle; and if he takes any
pleasure in the progeniture, he may
probably claim John Dennis (<i>v. infra</i>,
p. 436) as his son. That Boileau’s
treatment of him was quite unfair M.
Rigault himself fully admits; but to
whom and to what (including those
talents of his own which he by turns
prostitutes and cripples) is Boileau <em>not</em>
unfair?</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f356'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r356'>356</a>. As this of the very authors he
censures, “<span lang="fr">Leurs paroles, toutes mortes

<div class='footnote' id='f357'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r357'>357</a>. The literary <span lang="fr"><cite>Pensées</cite></span> of Pascal are
still fewer, and in dealing with Montaigne
he is even further from the
literary point of view than Malebranche.
His chief utterance is a
piece of characteristic scorn at poetical
<span lang="fr"><i>clichés</i></span> like <span lang="fr"><i>bel astre</i></span>, <span lang="fr"><i>fatal laurier</i></span>, &#38;c.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f358'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r358'>358</a>. Of the immense number (estimated
years ago at nearly five hundred) of
editions of the Works in whole or part,
that of Berriat de Saint-Prix in 4 vols.,
1830-34, is, I believe, as nearly the
standard as any.  There is, however,
a magnificent modern edition of the
<span lang="fr"><cite>Œuvres Poétiques</cite></span>, edited by M. Brunetière
(Paris, 1889), which I am glad
to possess. The ordinary “Collection”
editions, such as that of Garnier,
though complete enough on the verse
side, are apt to omit what they think
the less interesting pieces of prose.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f359'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r359'>359</a>. He was thirty-three when he began
it, and thirty-eight when it was
finished. A very excellent separate
edition of it is that of the Cambridge
University Press, by Mr D. Nichol
Smith (1898).</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f360'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r360'>360</a>. Boileau did not merely “convey”
from the ancients. He had the specially
ugly, though not so specially uncommon,
trick of insulting a man and
stealing from him at the same time.
(Cf. Théophile Gautier’s article, in <span lang="fr"><cite>Les
Grotesques</cite></span>, on his namesake.)</p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f362'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r362'>362</a>. It may be sometimes forgotten in
the quotation of this famous line, that
<em>long poem</em> was a technical term in
French criticism, from the days of the
Pléiade downwards, and means definitely
an Epic, or Heroic Poem, not a long
piece of verse. It is characteristic of
Boileau to hit backwards at the <i>modern</i>
epic, of which he was no admirer, in
this rather treacherous praise of the
sonnet, towards which he was equally
lukewarm.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f363'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r363'>363</a>. As it takes ten lines (171-180) in

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f365'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r365'>365</a>. I like to vary Boileau’s stale criticism
with his admirably fresh and
vigorous verse.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f366'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r366'>366</a>. “She can do without them,” as L.

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f367'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r367'>367</a>. As usual Boileau gives the actual
names of half a score inhabitants of the
French Grub Street, of whom Cyrano
de Bergerac (he was long dead, and
Boileau was safe) has the consolation
prize of being merely <span lang="fr"><i>fou</i></span>.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f368'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r368'>368</a>. They were probably the <span lang="fr"><i>tribut légitime</i></span>
which a <span lang="fr"><i>noble esprit</i></span> might derive
from his work.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f369'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r369'>369</a>. This refers to the <span lang="fr"><i>son</i></span>, François
(1628-1680), of a more poetic pair—Guillaume
(1598-1659) and Claudine
Colletet.  The former of these was
also a critic in his way, and left, besides
an <span lang="fr"><cite>Art Poétique</cite></span> (1658) of no great
value, a <span lang="fr"><cite>Histoire des Poètes Français</cite></span>
which, strangely enough, was never
printed, and the MS. of which was
burnt by the Vandals of the Commune
in 1871.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f370'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r370'>370</a>. A humourist might maintain the
two opposite theses, “That Boileau
has genuine authority,” and “That the
French are always craving for a tyrant,”
on the strength of a curious <span lang="la"><i>catena</i></span>
of evidence from Voltaire’s “<span lang="fr">Ça porte
malheur</span>” to Marmontel, who had presumed
to speak lightly of Despréaux,
down to M. Bourgoin’s “<span lang="fr">On a difficilement
raison contre Boileau.</span>” But to
those who “bear an English heart”
these terrors are idle.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f371'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r371'>371</a>. It is interesting and significant
that Boileau’s defenders generally drop
“Good Sense,” and use, whenever they
can, the more ambiguous and high-sounding
“Reason.” It is sufficient
to say that their author repeats “Good
Sense” again and again, and obviously
uses Reason as a mere synonym
for it.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f372'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r372'>372</a>. If I have seemed, or may seem, too
bitter in any remarks on Boileau, let
me here observe that few things in
literary history are more pathetic than
these last years of his, when, <span lang="la"><i>ultimus
suorum</i></span>, amid the ruins of the political
glories which he had celebrated, and in
a transition period between the great
literature of the seventeenth century
and that of the eighteenth, with no
one but his foolish Boswell-Eckermann,
Brossette, to comfort him, and no one
at all to whom to look as his successor,
he held—unconquered and unconquerable—to
his principles, and died, as one
of the poets to whom he was so unjust
had said,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>

<div class='footnote' id='f373'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r373'>373</a>. That he had taught Racine <span lang="fr"><i>rimer

that uncomplimentary comparison of
his pupil with Corneille, by which he
appears to have administered a sort
of private unction to his soul to atone
for his public <a id='corr291.39'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='injustice'>injustice.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_291.39'><ins class='correction' title='injustice'>injustice.</ins></a></span></p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f374'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r374'>374</a>. Not of course Boileau’s worthy
predecessor in Art-Poetic writing (<cite>v.
supra</cite>, pp. 117, 118), but an advocate
of the mid-seventeenth century, who
was unfortunate enough to commit
sonnets, and to be disliked by the
satirist.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f375'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r375'>375</a>. Even his admirers admit his
strange ignoring of the fact that
Madeleine de Scudéry <em>intended</em> her
personages to be modern—that they
were mere disguises of Condé and
others, not attempts to re-create
antiquity. This of course does not
exempt them from blame; but it
requires a different sort of blame.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f376'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r376'>376</a>. The condescending praise of “<span lang="fr">Arioste
<i>et ses fables comiques</i></span>,” in <i>A. P.</i>, iii.
291, can hardly be regarded as a set-off,
especially as just before (l. 218) he had
stigmatised him, emphasising the stigma
by a note, as “follement idolâtre et
païen.”</p>

account known to me, that of M. Bourgoin,
the question of Fénelon’s character
and of his relations with Bossuet
is brought in. It is really quite extraneous
to the matter. Very favourable
reference can be made to the
notice by the Cardinal de Bausset,
prefixed to the most accessible edition
of Fénelon’s critical work (in <span lang="fr"><cite>Œuvres
Choisies</cite></span>, Paris, Garnier, n.d.) Bausset,
who wrote, besides an extensive life of
Fénelon, one of Bossuet, and died in
1824, came before the Renaissance of
criticism in France: but he was no

with much humour and more truth,
to stigmatise the prim following of
grammar, the “substantive hand in

“walking behind with an adverb at
its heels, and an accusative in a place
unalterable.” <span lang="fr">“C’est ce,”</span> this great

between 1668 and 1671, except the
“Thucydides and Livy,” which appeared
ten years later. The <span lang="fr"><cite>Réflexions

more famous, on Poetics and Poets,
from 1674. His critical <span lang="fr"><cite>Works</cite></span> were
early collected, and the complete collection
appeared in English, by various
hands, including Rymer’s, in 2 vols.
(London, 1706). The Amsterdam ed.
of the original (3 vols., 1709-10) contains,
in addition, a small treatise, <span lang="fr"><cite>Du

be neglected, and some others, together
with the <span lang="fr"><cite>Comparaison de Pindare</cite></span> et

<p class='c000'><a href='#r391'>391</a>. Chap. vii. In the preceding
chapter there is one of those sentences
which ruin this kind of criticism, by
and of themselves. “Games are of
the number of those actions which
may occur in the lives of heroes.”
Most certainly: but one feels that
Rapin said it simply because there are
games in Homer and Virgil, and that,
if there had <em>not</em> been, he would probably
have said, “Games are <em>not</em>,” &#38;c.</p>

softens the crudity of the French

to oppose to the nasty niceness of the
French Jesuit the words of the author

is, and has to be, the kind of thing.
Perhaps such a glut of authorities may
have insensibly nauseated men of authority,
and so Baillet may have worked
both ways. He is good enough to admit
(v. 461) that “one cannot say this
nation [the English] is inferior even for
Poetry to several others of the North,”
and he has heard of “Abraham Cowley,
John Downe ou Jean Donne, Cleveland,
Edmond, [<i>sic</i>] Waller, Jean Denham,
George Herbert, le Chancelier Bacon,
Shakespeare, Fletcher, Beaumont, Ben,
Johnson, Suckling, Jean Milton,” &#38;c.
It is open to Shaconians to contend
that as the comma at “Edmond” is
undoubtedly superfluous, so is that at
“Bacon,” and that Baillet—the learned
Baillet—meant to rank “<span lang="fr">le Chancelier
Bacon-Shakespeare</span>” among poets.</p>

(3 vols., Paris, 1703-16). M. Bourgoin,
I think, refers to Gibert, but the
book was first brought seriously to my
notice by a very kind private communication
from Professor Scott of
the University of Michigan. Luckily
it is in the British Museum; but it
does not seem easy to obtain a copy
for oneself.  Gibert taught for some
half-century in the Collége Mazarin,
and was repeatedly rector of the University
of Paris. He wrote other
books,—a formal “Rhetoric” <span lang="la"><i>juxta
Aristotelis doctrinam</i></span>, strictures on
Rollin, &#38;c. Gibert is, it seems, appended
to some edd. of Baillet.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f404'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r404'>404</a>. See, for instance, his reference to
Patrizzi, who is evidently to him rather

tangible.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f405'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r405'>405</a>. His <span lang="fr"><cite>Parallèle des Anciens et des

even to fervent opponents of “the
sect of the Nicolaitans” and fervent
lovers of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Contes de ma Mère l’Oye</cite></span>.
That he knew little and that his case
was bad does not matter; but I at
least cannot find the <span lang="fr"><i>esprit</i></span> which
apologists plead.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f406'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r406'>406</a>. J. Warton (<cite>Adventurer</cite>, No. 49)
asserts, on the authority of Ménage,
that even Rapin was “totally ignorant”
of Greek.  M. does not quite
say this: but he does say that R. got
his Greek quotations from Tanneguy-Lefèvre,
Madame Dacier’s father (<span lang="fr"><cite>Ménagiana</cite></span>,
i. 175 of the collected ed.)</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f407'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r407'>407</a>. Perhaps it is still desirable, though
almost for the last time, to observe
that the omission of casual criticism in
non-critical work is intentional and
necessary.  Nowhere could more interesting
examples of it, from Molière
downwards, be produced; but this is
only a temptation, not a reason.</p>

<p class='c004'>That the Italians, who had some half of the last Book to
themselves, will not have a tithe of the present, is due, on the
part of the historian, neither to laziness, nor to love
of contrast, nor to that rather illogical and illegitimate
generosity which decrees that “the other
citizen shall have his turn.” <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Decadence of Italian Criticism.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The disproportion simply corresponds
to the facts. Italy, indeed, continued to devote herself
with something like enthusiasm—or at least with the <span lang="fr"><i>engouement</i></span>
of dilettantism and the doggedness of pedantry—to
critical studies. Some at least of the earlier writers of the
century—aftercrops of the sixteenth—still exercised considerable
influence: and for nearly the whole of the time the great
Italians of the former age—Scaliger, Castelvetro, and others—maintained
an authority which did not pass to France till the
eighteenth itself was approaching. But little was really added
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>to the critical canon of the central Peninsula. Paradoxers like
Beni, eccentrics of different kinds like Tassoni and Boccalini,
respectable compilers like Possevino and Aromatari, must occupy
us and receive their due. But all these belong more or less to
the first quarter of the century. The second, third, and fourth
are much less fertile, and it is not till another meeting of the
ages that we shall come to another really remarkable group,
consisting of two at least painful literary historians, among the
earliest of their kind, in Crescimbeni and Quadrio, of a real
though limited critic in Gravina, and of a remarkable combination
of erudition and insight in Muratori. And these
will properly be treated in the next Book, not in this.</p>

<p class='c000'>Paolo Beni, who has been spoken of in the last Book,<a id='r408'></a><a href='#f408' class='c019'><sup>[408]</sup></a> and
who was a man of nearly fifty when the sixteenth century
closed, had nevertheless nearly half his literary
life to spend in the seventeenth, and published
the most noteworthy of his works at this time. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Paolo Beni.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> We saw
that he was a strong “Torquatist,” and an innovator in respect
of recommending prose for tragedy as well as for
comedy. As he grew older the iconoclastic tendency so developed
in him that he may almost be called the leader of
Rebellion in the matter of the Ancient and Modern Quarrel;
for <span lang="la"><i>questa lite</i></span>, as a contemporary of Beni’s calls it, had been
fought out in Italy long before it became a burning one in
France and England. Beni was a “modern” of the extravagant
kind: and his two chief critical manifestoes, after the Dissertation
on Prose Drama, were a <span lang="it"><cite>Comparatione di Homero Virgilio e
Torquato</cite></span>,<a id='r409'></a><a href='#f409' class='c019'><sup>[409]</sup></a> where the author of the <cite>Gerusalemme</cite> (which Beni
prefers to call by its other title, <cite>Goffredo</cite>) is exalted far above
both the ancient Poets; and an <cite>Anti-Crusca</cite>,<a id='r410'></a><a href='#f410' class='c019'><sup>[410]</sup></a> in which, with
the futile courage of his opinions, he gives no more quarter to
Dante and Petrarch than to Homer and Virgil on the score of
language at least, and would apparently turn “modernity”
almost into “hodiernity.” This does not argue any great
critical spirit: and we find little in Beni—only the sort of
Old Bailey advocacy, or attack, which was rapidly coming to
be the disgrace of criticism. There is not “the real integrity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>and perfection of the fable” in the <cite>Odyssey</cite>. Even Virgil
cannot approach Tasso in regularity, nice derangement of
episodes, &#38;c., &#38;c. The most amusing thing about Beni is the
way in which he turns the batteries of the classics on themselves.
He does not attempt to make a new Poetic for
Romances, nor does he take his favourite poem on its own
merits and extol it for them. The “parts,” the “qualities,”
the “rules” are practically adopted: and it is shown—or at
least asserted—that Tasso exhibits them all in greater perfection
than the ancients. This is the line afterwards taken by
Addison with <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <span lang="la"><cite>Bibliotheca Selecta</cite></span> of Antonio Possevino, Jesuit negotiator
and teacher, is a good example of the kind of compiling work
which the great development of Criticism was imposing
on at least some critics. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Possevino. His</i> <span lang="it">Bibliotheca Selecta.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> From some points of view
it also may seem to belong rather to the last Book,
for Possevino, who retired from active work in many
countries to his native land and an old age of study in 1586,
brought it out first at Rome in 1593. But he made alterations
and rearrangements in it afterwards, and the edition I have
used<a id='r411'></a><a href='#f411' class='c019'><sup>[411]</sup></a> was published, with his own approval and assistance,
a few years before his death, and well within the seventeenth
century. It is a mighty folio (or rather two in one) dealing with
something like the whole range of studies, and intended, it would
seem, rather for teachers than learners; but the First Book<a id='r412'></a><a href='#f412' class='c019'><sup>[412]</sup></a>
has something, and the three last much, to do with our subject.
In these three Possevino successively discusses History at
enormous length<a id='r413'></a><a href='#f413' class='c019'><sup>[413]</sup></a> and with considerable bibliographical information,
Poetry<a id='r414'></a><a href='#f414' class='c019'><sup>[414]</sup></a> at somewhat less, and finally the Art of
Letter Writing, under the special title of “Cicero,” but with
reference also to Libanius and others. Possevino, as was in
fact inevitable from his profession and his purpose, is very
much cumbered about orthodoxy and morality, especially in
the poetical department; but he does not allow himself to be
wholly guided by these considerations. Scaliger’s <cite>Poetic</cite> he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>calls <span lang="la"><i>spissum sane opus</i></span>—a happy but rather ambiguous epithet;
quotes Gambara, Minturno, Cinthio, Pigna, and Patrizzi as
main authorities, and though he says that he will <i>not</i> quote
Castelvetro, as being on the Index, evidently means that he
should be read, though he duly prescribes Caro as an antidote.
He has a good selection of extracts, mighty lists of books and
authorities, and an inserted tract (two in fact) by Macarius
Mutius on Poetry and Christian Poetry, by which he sets much
store, but in which little will be found but rhetoric.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of the most interesting and suggestive, if not the most
regular, criticism in this part of Italian literature is to be found
in the <span lang="it"><cite>Pensieri Diversi</cite></span> of Alessandro Tassoni.<a id='r415'></a><a href='#f415' class='c019'><sup>[415]</sup></a> <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Tassoni. His</i> <span lang="it">Pensieri Diversi.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The
author of the <span lang="it"><cite>Secchia Rapita</cite></span> was not likely to be
dull in anything that he undertook: and his undertakings
were of a sufficiently various kind.<a id='r416'></a><a href='#f416' class='c019'><sup>[416]</sup></a> In his
<span lang="it"><cite>Considerazioni</cite></span><a id='r417'></a><a href='#f417' class='c019'><sup>[417]</sup></a> on Petrarch he treated that revered sonneteer
and his sonnets as cavalierly as he was to treat the sacred
Heroic Poem in the <span lang="it"><cite>Secchia</cite></span>: but this kind of <span lang="fr"><i>frondeur</i></span> spirit
was nothing new in Italy. The <span lang="it"><cite>Pensieri</cite></span>, in which their author
was candidly prepared to find people discovering “extravagance
and capriciousness,” are modelled on Aristotle’s <cite>Problems</cite>, and
Plutarch’s <cite>Symposiacs</cite> and <cite>Roman Questions</cite>. They deal with
curious matters “such as are wont to come into the discourse
of Gentlemen and Professors of Literature,” a phrase where the
“and” is half complimentary and half the reverse. On perusing
the contents we find that gentlemen and professors of literature
talk about the radical humours, and the reason of the spots on the
moon, and why it is that ugly ladies are loved, and a very great
many other interesting things. They do it, moreover (at least
Tassoni does it for them), in a very interesting manner—that
peculiar early seventeenth-century mixture of learning, fancy,
and humour which, in still greater measure, gives Burton
and Browne their quintessenced charm. If Tassoni had pushed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>that question about the <span lang="it"><i>donne brutte</i></span> home, he might have rediscovered,
against his own age, the great secret of criticism;
but of this we may treat more properly in the Interchapter. It
is not till the Tenth Book of the <span lang="it"><cite>Pensieri</cite></span> that he attacks literature,
save by incidence and tangent; and then he plunges full
into the Battle of the Ancients and Moderns, devoting twenty-seven
out of twenty-eight chapters to an elaborate comparison
of the two periods, in every class of art, science, and literature
itself. But he preserves his invincible quaintness by going off in
the twenty-eighth to a very elaborate study of the Hangman (<span lang="it"><cite>Il
Boia</cite></span>), which readers of Joseph de Maistre should not fail to compare
with the <span lang="fr"><cite>Soirées de Saint-Pétersbourg</cite></span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tassoni deals with the general question in the same curious
indirect and ironical fashion in which he handles the charms
of <span lang="it"><i>bruttezza</i></span>, and the reason why it was specially rude (let
us say, though he does not) of Spenser to call the husband of
Hellenore Mal<em>becco</em>. He begins by advancing, and even seeming
to countenance, the “Modern” argument for Progress, as being
the law of nature and so decisive of <span lang="la"><i>questa lite</i></span>. But he very
soon turns round, and gives reasons and instances for the much
sounder doctrine of Fluctuation—not merely in general, but in
regard to particular Arts. Therefore it is necessary to examine
these Arts; and then he does this. Once more he becomes a
“Modern” in awarding to his countrymen the palm of grammatico-critical
studies. In Logic and Philosophy generally,
he thinks they can match the Latins, and though they yield
to the Greeks, may make some fight even with them. He
will pit Guicciardini, Comines, and Giovio against any of the
ancients, which is a little rash; putting Machiavelli with
others in a second rank. And on the modern side of Oratory
he urges, with his unconquerable unexpectedness, Peter the
Hermit and John of Munster! But on the Poets this unexpectedness
of his turns to the disappointing. He gives us
a very unnecessary classification of Kinds, obviously in order
that he may quote his own <span lang="it"><cite>Secchia</cite></span> as a new kind, the Heroi-comic.
But it is interesting to find him dividing the <span lang="it"><cite>Commedia</cite></span>
into “Heroi-satiric” for the <span lang="it"><cite>Inferno</cite></span>, Heroic mixed with Hymnic
for the <span lang="it"><cite>Paradiso</cite></span>, and a division (not, as in the <span lang="it"><cite>Inferno</cite></span>, a <em>blend</em>)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>of Heroic and Satiric for the <cite>Purgatory</cite>. Except on this head
of <span lang="la"><i>questa lite</i></span>, in which he is a notable forerunner of later disputants,
Tassoni has little that is positively critical. And
if he shows on the one hand a singularly active and inquiring
spirit, such as may any day discover fresh and promising outlooks,
he shows us also the risk of mere fantastic “problem”-raising,
to which a century of active criticism was leading a
century of Academies.<a id='r418'></a><a href='#f418' class='c019'><sup>[418]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Tassoni’s Petrarch-blasphemies brought him into collision
with Giuseppe Aromatari, of whose original work, including
his part in this battle,<a id='r419'></a><a href='#f419' class='c019'><sup>[419]</sup></a> I do not know much. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Aromatari.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But
Aromatari was responsible, many years later, for a
remarkable encyclopædia or <span lang="la"><i>corpus</i></span>, which may very well follow
the <span lang="it"><cite>Pensieri Diversi</cite></span> as a pendant to Possevino’s work already
mentioned, and as illustrating the learned and scholastic side.
It is entitled <span lang="it"><cite>Degli Autori del Ben Parlare</cite></span>,<a id='r420'></a><a href='#f420' class='c019'><sup>[420]</sup></a> and, if its grammatical
and Rhetorical divisions had been succeeded by a
similar collection of Poetics, it would have gone far to cover, in
a certain peculiar and limited way, the entire field of criticism.
As it is, not a few of its documents extend in the poetic
direction. Its first volume gives the promise of an almost
unique thesaurus, starting with illustrative and comparative
extracts from Hesiod, Lucian, Cicero, Xenophon, &#38;c., then giving
the whole of Dante’s <span lang="la"><cite>De Vulgari Eloquentia</cite></span> in the Italian,
and following this with Trissino’s <span lang="it"><cite>Castellano</cite></span>, Tolomei’s <span lang="it"><cite>Cesano</cite></span>,
a discourse of Varchi, and “Opinions” from Mutio, Doni,
Dolce, Citadini, and others, all on the subject of the Vulgar
Tongue. Other treatises, including Bembo’s, with less famous
ones by Alunno, Delminio, and others, follow; while two whole
parts are given up to Salviati’s <span lang="it"><cite>Avvertimenti della Lingua</cite></span> on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>Boccaccio. Not seldom the grammatical matter touches points
very important indeed to criticism, as for instance in vol. vi.,
where Buonmattei enters on the question (made a burning one
in France by Malherbe) whether popular or literary usage is
to be the standard of correctness.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rhetorical part has the additional interest of combining
ancient and modern matter—of being, in short, a kind of compressed
<span lang="la"><cite>Rhetorici Græci et Latini</cite></span> with modern
additions. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His</i> <span lang="it">Degli Autori del Ben Parlare.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Sometimes the texts are given simply
in whole or part—Aristotle, Longinus, Hermogenes
being thus treated—while an Introduction to Hermogenes
by Giulio Camillo Delminio shows how strongly the
authority of that master was working, and how much it had
to do with the insistence on criticism by Kinds and Qualities.
Sometimes a <span lang="la"><i>catena</i></span> of authorities on particular matters is
given—as in the case of Tropes and Figures, where the chain
stretches from Quintilian to Mazzoni. Only specialists, probably,
will care to investigate profoundly the huge commentary-paraphrase
of Panigarola on Demetrius Phalereus, readjusted
to the purposes of sacred Oratory, though the book had a great
vogue in its day. But one turns with more interest to the
work of Patrizzi on Rhetoric, much less known as it is than
his <span lang="it"><cite>Della Poetica</cite></span> and <span lang="it"><cite>Della Storia</cite></span>. It has, however, hardly any
of the interest of the <span lang="it"><cite>Poetica</cite></span>, being almost entirely devoted
to the <em>subjects</em> of the orator, and philosophical rather than
literary in its handling. But this great medley of Aromatari’s
shows us, better perhaps than any single book except Baillet’s,
and nearly fifty years before it, the bulk and importance of
the position which the critical consideration of literature was
taking among literary studies.</p>

<p class='c000'>The literary side of Boccalini’s <span lang="it"><cite>Ragguagli di Parnasso</cite></span><a id='r421'></a><a href='#f421' class='c019'><sup>[421]</sup></a> is less
than the political. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Boccalini and Minors.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But the list of seventeenth-century treatises
in Italian on critical subjects is long.<a id='r422'></a><a href='#f422' class='c019'><sup>[422]</sup></a> Some of them
are difficult to procure out of Italy, and I doubt
whether many are worth the trouble of hunting down. I am
sorry that the work of Chiodino da Monte-Melone<a id='r423'></a><a href='#f423' class='c019'><sup>[423]</sup></a> has hitherto
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>escaped me, because of the extreme beauty of the name, which
would seem to qualify its author for the post of Chief Rhetorician
to Queen Pintiquinestra. Pellegrino, Fioretti, Zani, Querengo,
Menzini have not been or shall not be forgotten. But I have
experienced, and fear again, the sort of disappointment which
occurs when, for instance,<a id='r424'></a><a href='#f424' class='c019'><sup>[424]</sup></a> one is told, of Carlo Rinaldini,<a id='r425'></a><a href='#f425' class='c019'><sup>[425]</sup></a>
that the third part of his <span lang="la"><cite>Philosophia Rationalis</cite></span> “contains a
tolerable Poetic.” One attacks the mighty double-columned
folio, and finds a purely scholastic treatise of the familiar kind,
beginning with <span lang="it"><i>Poetice</i></span>, <span lang="it"><i>Poeta</i></span>, <span lang="it"><i>Poesis</i></span>, <span lang="it"><i>Poema</i></span> as of old. It is
impossible to say <span lang="la"><i>Non debes quadrillare</i></span> in this fashion—the
company is too ancient and venerable; but it is permissible
to decline to play, on the strength of having had enough of
the game already. There is a certain established conformity
of propriety between times and books. At no time can a frank
commentary on Aristotle be out of date or out of place; at this
time the Poetics of Le Bossu and Bouhours, faulty as they
are, were at any rate responsive to the form and pressure
of the day. But such work as Rinaldini’s, however respectable,
has neither the intrinsic excellence which conquers time, nor
the fleeting but real grace of temporal congruity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <span lang="it"><cite>Ragguagli di Parnasso</cite></span> themselves are of less importance
to us for their actual critical utterances (which, as has been
said, were not Boccalini’s first object) than for the
extraordinary influence which they exercised on the
form of criticism throughout Europe for more than
a century. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Influence of the</i> <span lang="it">Ragguagli.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Suggested more or less directly by Lucian (whose
enormous effect on modern European literature, though of
course never missed entirely by any competent person, has
never yet been fully allowed for) they hit the taste of the
day straight and full. Not merely did they start the whole
fleet of “Sessions of the Poets” and the like in England,
but they had a great influence on the English prose Essayists
of the early eighteenth century;<a id='r426'></a><a href='#f426' class='c019'><sup>[426]</sup></a> while in France even the
severe Boileau paid them unacknowledged royalty. It is no
uncommon experience to find that books which in this way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>create a kind of “rage” at one time, become chiefly sources of
boredom at another; but Boccalini certainly illustrates the fact,
in his literary portions at any rate. He deserves some credit
for having made current, if he did not invent, the famous story
of the choice between Guicciardini and the galleys. There is
some critical appropriateness in the fable of Tasso being refused
admission by Castelvetro on the alleged strength of Aristotle’s
rules, of the reprimand bestowed by Apollo on the philosopher,
and of his excuse that he never meant his observations for
“rules” at all. To this the age might have paid more attention
than it did. But one finds thinness in the fun of Justus Lipsius
attacking Tacitus for impiety, and of Thrasea and Priscus being
warned, as they value their stoical characters, not to go and see
Vittoria Colonna and Veronica Gambara too often.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the History of Taste as distinguished from that of Criticism
the important point of the <span lang="it"><i>Seicento</i></span> is of course that development
of floridity—of Marinism—which is associated
in literary history with the very term. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The set of Seicentist taste.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>But this
development was common to Italy with all Europe;
and though the country still exercised a sort of prerogative influence,
“Marinism” is not so much the mother as the elder,
and not by so very much the elder, sister of Gongorism in
Spain, of the extravagances of the age before Boileau in France,
of the “metaphysical” fashion in England. It will be better
to treat these in the Interchapter, both in themselves and as
fastening “correctness,” by way of reaction, upon Europe.</p>

<p class='c004'>Spain has never ranked very high in the general estimate
as a contributor to European criticism: and though
this estimate has not been too solidly founded, the
<span lang="la"><cite>communis sensus</cite></span> seems here to have exercised that
mysterious power of appeal to the world-spirit which
so often keeps it from going hopelessly wrong.<a id='r427'></a><a href='#f427' class='c019'><sup>[427]</sup></a> <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Spanish criticism—Highly ranked by Dryden?</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> There is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>however, one remarkable piece of testimony which, if it were a
little better authenticated, would give Spanish critics a very
high position as teachers. We shall see in a future chapter
that Dryden (as has indeed been generally, though, until recent
times, but vaguely, allowed) is himself one of the great turning-points
of the critical story of Europe. Now Spence says that
Bolingbroke told him that Dryden had assured <em>him</em> that “he
got more from the Spanish critics alone than from the Italian
and French and all others together.” Unfortunately Spence
speaks at second-hand; and Bolingbroke, even if he really did
say this, is always a Bardolphian security. Moreover, Dryden,
who was not at all in the habit of concealing his indebtedness, but,
on the contrary, seems to have “felt an innocent warmth” of
pleasure in mustering and marshalling his authorities, quotes no
Spanish authors. And the references (which are fairly numerous)
to Spanish plays in the <cite>Essay of Dramatic Poesy</cite> neither
quote, nor necessarily show knowledge of, Spanish critics at all.
It has been thought that Dryden may have read Tirso de Molina’s
<span lang="es"><cite>Cigarrales</cite></span> (<i>v. infra</i>); and it has occurred to me that something
in his attitude may have been derived from Lope’s <span lang="es"><cite>Arte Nuevo
de hacer Comedias</cite></span>. But I do not believe this to be at all certain,
or even very probable.<a id='r428'></a><a href='#f428' class='c019'><sup>[428]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>Intrinsically, however, Spanish criticism before the eighteenth
century, though not extraordinarily rich nor furnishing any
documents of extreme importance, is interesting, and
in one point almost supremely so, for circumstances
if not for contents. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Origins—Villena.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The trail begins fairly early, though the
scent is scattered at uncommonly long intervals. A glance was
made towards the close of the first volume of this book at the
actual beginnings. They were due to two persons of the greatest
distinction in the early fifteenth century—Enrique, Marquis(?)<a id='r429'></a><a href='#f429' class='c019'><sup>[429]</sup></a>
de Villena and Master of Calatrava, of the blood royal both
of Aragon and Castille, and Iñigo Lopez de Mendoza, Marquis of
Santillana. The <span lang="fr"><cite>Arte de Trobar</cite></span><a id='r430'></a><a href='#f430' class='c019'><sup>[430]</sup></a> of the former, a treatise on
the Gay Science, was sent by him, a year before his death, in
1434, to the latter; and Santillana himself touched criticism,
or at least Poetics, both in the Preface to his <cite>Proverbs</cite>, and
still more in a letter to the Constable (Dom Pedro) of Portugal,
written about 1455, not long before his own death, and containing
observations not merely on Poetry in general, but on early
Spanish poets up to his own times. This document was fortunately,
and most wisely, prefixed by Sanchez to his collection
of the older Spanish poets, and is easily accessible in the
re-edition of Ochoa,<a id='r431'></a><a href='#f431' class='c019'><sup>[431]</sup></a> or in the Appendix to Señor Menéndez'
<cite>History</cite>, vol. ii.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Marquis begins, after compliments, by the usual generalities
about poetry containing “useful things covered
with a very pretty coverlet, composed, distinguished,
and scanned in certain number, weight, and measure.” <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Santillana.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> So “as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>fructiferous gardens abound and give convenient fruits,” &#38;c.,
&#38;c., with Tully to give security. But for all his own very
pretty coverlet of rhetoric, the Marquis talks very good sense.
He is sure that verse is above prose, basing himself soundly on
Isidore of Seville and his proofs from Hebrew literature, with
the Greeks to follow, and Cassiodorus to back up Isidore. Then
he comes to modern times—to Petrarch and Robert of Naples,
to Boccaccio and John of Cyprus, quoting the <span lang="la"><cite>De Genealogia</cite></span>
itself, and therefore, in a very interesting way, gearing on
Spanish criticism, even in these its rudiments, to Italian, then
not much less rudimentary. He divides styles properly into
“sublime,” “middle,” and “low,” liberally placing all those who
write in Greek or Latin in the first class. The middle contains
those who write in any vulgar tongue; the low those who
merely botch up romances and songs for the common people,
without order or rule. Dante wrote the <i>Commedia “elegantemente,”</i>
and Boccaccio composed proses of <span lang="it"><cite>grand eloquencia</cite></span> in the
manner of Boethius. Santillana then shows himself well read in
Provençal, French, and Catalan, as well as Italian. He refers to
the <span lang="fr"><cite>Roman de la Rose</cite></span> and its authors, to “Michaute” (Machault),
Otho de “Crantzon” (Granson), “Alen Charrotier,” whom, naturally,
he much admires. He thinks the Italians surpass the
French in genius, the French the Italians in art. Then he
turns to Spain, and beginning with those who have written in
the Provençal style, comes to Gallegan, Castilian, &#38;c., later,
mentions the chief poets, gives the metres in which they have
written, and ends with a (mis)quotation of Horace<a id='r432'></a><a href='#f432' class='c019'><sup>[432]</sup></a> and a
shower of classical allusions—among others to <span lang="es"><i>aquellas dueñas
que en torno de la fuente Elicon incesantemente danzan</i></span>. For
even then the modern confusion of the Mount and the Fount
had begun. The piece is, if not very advanced criticism, at
any rate an early and interesting critical glance over European
poetry in the Romance tongues.</p>

<p class='c000'>Villena, as his title shows, and Santillana to some extent, had
been considering Catalan and Galician as the chief poetic media
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>for Spaniards; it is different with Juan del Encina, who, in
1496,<a id='r433'></a><a href='#f433' class='c019'><sup>[433]</sup></a> prefixed an <span lang="es"><cite>Arte</cite></span> to his <span lang="es"><cite>Cancionero</cite></span> nearly half
a century after Santillana wrote, and almost as long
after an earlier <span lang="es"><cite>Cancionero</cite></span>, that of Baena, the compiler of which
does not seem to have been tempted to criticism. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Encina.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The nine
chapters of this deal with the origin of Castilian poetry, the
distinction between the art of poetry and the <span lang="es"><i>arte de trobar</i></span>,
while both <em>have</em> an art; the necessities of the <span lang="es"><i>trobador</i></span>, feet,
consonance and assonance, verses and couplets, poetic “colours,”
&#38;c., and a general conclusion on writing and reading poetry.
The book shows a certain Italian influence which distinguishes
it from earlier work; but which, when that Italian influence
had been repeated in stronger dose, seemed to later generations
insufficient and out of date. Still, it is interesting, and earlier
than anything of the kind in vernacular Italian.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another half-way house may be found in the interesting
<span lang="es"><cite>Diálogo de La Lengua</cite></span> or <span lang="es"><cite>de Las Lenguas</cite></span><a id='r434'></a><a href='#f434' class='c019'><sup>[434]</sup></a> of Juan de Valdés,
which has even been called “an important monument
of literary criticism.” <span class='sni side5'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Valdés.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It is rather, however,
linguistic than literary, though the author deserves to rank
with other national heroes of the time for his strenuous support
of the vernacular, which he thought a more “corrupted”
representative of Latin than Italian, and respecting which he
held the odd but characteristically Renaissance notion that
Greek, not Basque, was its remoter ancestor. He mentions
the romances and the <span lang="es"><cite>Celestina</cite></span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the regular course of technical and elaborate Spanish
criticism does not begin, after these long preliminary stages,
till quite the close of the sixteenth century. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The beginning of regular Criticism. Humanist Rhetoricians.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The earlier course
of that century has indeed supplied Señor Menéndez with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>tolerably fair herd of humanist rhetoricians to fill the ninety
pages of his ninth chapter. The list is headed
by Antonio de Nebrija (Nebrissensis), <span lang="la"><cite>De Artis
Rhetoricæ compendiosa coaptatione ex Aristotele Cicerone
et Quintiliano</cite></span>, in 1529. But the only names of
much interest that appear in it are those of the
famous Luis Vives, disciple of Erasmus and of Oxford, with
his anti-Ciceronianism, and with at least some admission (the
passage is quoted by Señor Menéndez at vol. iii. on p. 226 from
the <span lang="la"><cite>De causis Corruptarum Artium</cite></span>), that it does not matter in
what language a man writes in so far as faults and impurities
of diction and the duty of avoiding them are concerned; and of
the equally famous preacher Luis de Granada, with his <span lang="es"><cite>Rhetorica
Ecclesiastica</cite></span>, a good deal later. Still, the metrical <cite>Rhetoric</cite>
(1569) of Arias Montano, that “Lope of Latin verse,” a piece of
didactic much more spirited and really poetical than Vida’s
<cite>Poetic</cite>, on which no doubt it is modelled; and the vigorous if
mistaken scholasticism of Francesco Sanchez (“<span lang="es">El Brocense</span>”),
in his attempt to subject Rhetoric entirely to Logic, deserve
some notice. So, perhaps, does Alfonso Garcia Matamoros,
who, though Señor Menéndez conscientiously suspects him of
not being very original, stumbled upon a remarkable anticipation
of Buffon in the definition <span lang="la"><i>Est stylus habitus orationis, a
cujusque hominis natura fluens</i></span>. This is a slight but distinct
advance on the earlier one of Fox Morcillo, <span lang="la"><cite>De Imitatione</cite></span>
(1544), which gives it as something <span lang="la"><i>quæ vel pro ingenio cujusquam,
vel rei, quæ in questionem vocatur, ratione varietur</i></span>. These
writers, however, seem (except El Brocense, who dealt on more
than one occasion with the Horatian <cite>Art</cite>) to have given little
or no attention to Poetics, and in fact to have allowed themselves
to drift a good deal to leeward of the purely literary
side of Rhetoric altogether. When the ship bore up again for
this side, the Spaniards, like everybody else in Europe without
exception, took the Italians for their schoolmasters; and
they might seem all the more certain to be docile pupils
in that their poetical practice—their practice indeed in all
sorts of regular writing—had long been under the same
influence. Boscan had more or less deliberately Italianated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>Spanish poetry<a id='r435'></a><a href='#f435' class='c019'><sup>[435]</sup></a> half a century before Rengifo,<a id='r436'></a><a href='#f436' class='c019'><sup>[436]</sup></a> and Pinciano,
and La Cueva, in the last decade of the sixteenth century
and the first of the seventeenth, began to theorise. At the
same time there was a very important point of difference
between Spain and all other European nations, except to some
extent England. In the contents of the Cancioneros—perhaps
not in actual form very old, but stretching back by tradition
and association to the very blending-time of Goth, and Cantabrian,
and Latin—and in the drama which had been so rapidly
maturing from Naharro to Lope de Vega, the Spaniards had
two mighty, popular, and intensely anti-"regular" forms of
literary composition. The critical “dependence” therefore—the
point to be fought out—was, “Which was to prevail?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr Spingarn’s thesis, that translation of the <cite>Epistle to the Pisos</cite>
is the invariable prelude of original critical work, completes its
proofs, as far as the Latin races are concerned, by the
version of Espinel which appeared in 1591, and was
followed in the very next year by Rengifo’s <span lang="es"><cite>Arte Poética
Española</cite></span>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Poetics. Rengifo.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Of the former there is little to say, for though
Espinel was a man of literary gift (he was the author, it may
be excusable to remind the reader, of <span lang="es"><cite>Marcos de Obregón</cite></span>, and so
a slight, though only a slight, creditor of Le Sage), he did not
add anything original to his translation. The latter has been
sometimes rather unkindly spoken of by those who do not like
formal Arts of Poetry. Those, on the other hand, who have weak
places in their hearts for such things may give Rengifo shelter
therein. He reminds one at very first sight of his Italian
originals in the comely small quarto of his <em>format</em>—the book-size
of all others which retains a certain dignity without entirely
forfeiting the benefit of the Archpriest of Hita’s celebration
of <span lang="es"><i>dueñas pequeñas</i></span>: he has a beautiful folding plate of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span><span lang="es"><cite>Labyrinto</cite></span>—one of the artificial forms which are dear because
they maddened the eighteenth century—and he gives a large
<span lang="es"><cite>Sylva</cite></span> or rhyming dictionary. I do not know that there is
much else to be said for him, but he is a symptom.<a id='r437'></a><a href='#f437' class='c019'><sup>[437]</sup></a> So,
some twenty years later is, on the other side, the severe
Cascales,<a id='r438'></a><a href='#f438' class='c019'><sup>[438]</sup></a> who in his <span lang="es"><cite>Tablas Poéticas</cite></span><a id='r439'></a><a href='#f439' class='c019'><sup>[439]</sup></a> lays it down that “if
any part of a fable can be changed without loss, this fable
is not well managed.” There was a contemporary of Cascales
in a country which loved not Spain, neither was loved of her,
who would have changed you every part of every one of his
fables, and left the versions so that you could not tell which
was the better.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some years after Rengifo came Pinciano, and ten years later
the Spanish attempt to rival Vida and Vauquelin in the <span lang="es"><cite>Ejemplar
Poético</cite></span> of Juan de La Cueva. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Pinciano.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The two are
opposed on the point which was rapidly becoming
the burning question of Spanish literary criticism, but which
was never thoroughly faced in Spain. The great national
drama—in main part, if not in every respect, Romantic to the
core—was making progress every day; but so was the theory
that you were to follow the ancients. Alfonso Lopez, otherwise
“<span lang="es">El Pinciano,</span>” did the latter diligently in his <span lang="es"><cite>Filosofía Antigua
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>Poética</cite></span>,<a id='r440'></a><a href='#f440' class='c019'><sup>[440]</sup></a> which, besides the authorities indicated in the title,
owed much to the Italian school.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pinciano<a id='r441'></a><a href='#f441' class='c019'><sup>[441]</sup></a> is set extraordinarily high by the Historian of Spanish
criticism, who thinks him “the only humanist of the sixteenth
century who presents a complete literary system,” contrasts him
(I own that this gives me pause) with the “intolerable pedantries”
of Castelvetro, and calls him plumply “an excellent critic.”
The quotations advanced, though, according to Señor Menéndez'
admirable custom with authors difficult of access, they are plentifully
given, will perhaps hardly justify this praise. Pinciano
thinks that “the soul of poetry is the fable”; that metre is not
necessary, though it “perfects imitation”; that imitation itself
must have verisimilitude; that poetry is superior to metaphysic;
that it ranges over all the arts and sciences; that it gives things
in a new form, makes them new to the world; that a perfectly
organised fable is like a perfectly organised animal; that it is
absurd for a hero to be born, grow up, become bearded, marry,
&#38;c., all in one piece. He prefers the probable-impossible to
the improbable-possible, disapproves of classical metres, and
so forth—all of which we have, I think, heard before. Señor
Menéndez attributes to him <span lang="es"><i>altísimo entendimiento crítico</i></span> for
rejecting the common (and certainly absurd enough) division of
comedy and tragedy by the happy or unhappy ending, and vesting
the comic element in Ridicule. And he winds up by constituting
Pinciano, with Cascales and Gonzales de Salas, “the
luminous triad of our <em>preceptists</em> of the good age.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Recurrence to, and study of, the book itself as given by
Señor Peña will not, I think, remove the doubts about this
high estimate of the <span lang="es"><cite>Filosofía</cite></span> which even Señor Menéndez'
own quotations may have started. It is a book of much
learning, ingenuity, and labour, the somewhat non-natural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>form of which (the recounting in letters to a certain Don
Gabriel by El Pinciano<a id='r442'></a><a href='#f442' class='c019'><sup>[442]</sup></a> of conversations between himself and
two friends, Hugo and Fadrique) may, like much else in it,
be due to Italian influence. That of such writers as Fracastoro
is obvious in the philosophical aloofness of the first Epistle-dialogue,
<span lang="es"><cite>De la Felicidad Humana</cite></span>, in which the nature of virtue,
the character of the Pagan divinities, and many other solemn
things are discussed, with some curious ones, such as whether
<span lang="es"><i>nobleza</i></span> can be predicated of Lais either for her beauty or her
eminence in an <span lang="es"><i>oficio deshonesto</i></span>. It is Don Gabriel’s answer
which deflects the subject with some sharpness into <span lang="es"><i>una Arte
Poética en romance</i></span>, and this, beginning in the next letter,
occupies the rest of the book. The divisions are pretty usual:
first, the general qualities of, and objections to, Poetry; then its
nature, its different kinds, the Fable, Poetic diction, metre,
tragedy, and comedy; dithyrambic, epic, minor poetry; and
lastly, “Actors.” Pinciano calls these divisions modestly
enough <span lang="es"><cite>Fragmentos</cite></span>, but no just exception can be taken to
them on the ground of scrappiness. The book is methodical
enough; its <span lang="fr"><i>aperçus</i></span> (as, for instance, on <span lang="la"><i>furor poeticus</i></span> and
poetic diction) are often acute, and its expression not seldom
has the quaint raciness of Spanish.<a id='r443'></a><a href='#f443' class='c019'><sup>[443]</sup></a> But it still “sticks in
generals”; it still holds those generals to have been settled
once for all of old; and it still gives no sign of any catholic
examination of actual poetry.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the other hand, La Cueva,<a id='r444'></a><a href='#f444' class='c019'><sup>[444]</sup></a> though meticulous enough,
and citing with high reverence<a id='r445'></a><a href='#f445' class='c019'><sup>[445]</sup></a> not merely Aristotle and Horace,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>but Scaliger himself, Vida, Minturno, Viperano, and others, is,
on the drama at least, and especially on comedy, an
utter contemner of the ancient doctrine. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>La Cueva.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> My friend
Mr Hannay’s pithy statement<a id='r446'></a><a href='#f446' class='c019'><sup>[446]</sup></a> of this Spanish point of view has
already commended itself to good judges,<a id='r447'></a><a href='#f447' class='c019'><sup>[447]</sup></a> and it seems to sum
up the whole matter. “The theatre was to imitate nature and
to please. Poetry was to imitate the Italians, and satisfy the
orthodox but minute critic.” There had been something of this
in Castelvetro; there was more in the Spaniards, and it was
fatal to them as critics.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Carvallo.</i></div>

<p class='c000'>Of the authors of this group with whom I am myself acquainted,
none seems to me to stand higher than Gonzales de
Salas on the Aristotelian-Senecan side; while few
exhibit rehashings of the common stuff to be found
in all the Italian books more strikingly than Carvallo in his
<span lang="es"><cite>Cisne de Apolo</cite></span>.<a id='r448'></a><a href='#f448' class='c019'><sup>[448]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Gonzales de Salas,<a id='r449'></a><a href='#f449' class='c019'><sup>[449]</sup></a> on the contrary, strikes me as having
shown distinct and original critical power. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Gonzales de Salas.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> A foreigner is
not likely to be greatly disturbed, even if he
be a better Spanish scholar than I am, by the
“palpable” darkness,<a id='r450'></a><a href='#f450' class='c019'><sup>[450]</sup></a> the “accumulation of obscurity and
troublesomeness” in style, with which Señor Menéndez
reproaches Salas. It is an odd thing, but might be
paralleled elsewhere, that the foreigner, who does not know
what the man <em>ought</em> to have said in order to convey his
meaning properly, can, in nearly all languages, arrive at that
meaning more easily than the native, who is “put off”
by eccentricity and barbarisms. Words, for instance, like
<span lang="es"><i>lucifugas</i></span> and <span lang="es"><i>parasangas</i></span>, which Don Marcelino holds up to
special reproach, are to an Englishman, with his Virgil and his
Xenophon in his head, perhaps easier reading than some of the
bluest-blooded words of pure Spanish. The critic is further
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>enraged by Salas’s devotion to Seneca, whose <span lang="es"><cite>Troades</cite></span> he actually
translated, with observations and exercitations thereon.
But (as students of English at least should know) there is much
Romantic virtue in your Seneca along with his Classical vice.
The curious thing about Gonzales is that—fervent Aristotelian
as he is in theory, and devotee of the ancient theatre down to
the Tragic Boot—he has singular “pluckings of apples by the
banks of Ulai,” strange glimpses of the truths which his countrymen
were the best situated of all men in Europe (with hardly
the exception of Englishmen) for seeing, but which as a rule
they would not see. Both Pinciano and Cascales had eulogised
Nature or <span lang="es"><cite>Naturaleza</cite></span>; but as the foundress or foundation of
Laws which Cascales at any rate would have as those of the
Medes and Persians. Gonzales, Aristotelian as he is, on the other
hand, says in so many words,<a id='r451'></a><a href='#f451' class='c019'><sup>[451]</sup></a> “You are not bound to follow
the ancients,” “Time and taste may improve and alter art.”
Señor Menéndez thinks this liberty a Spanish trait; but we
find it in some Italians, though not many, and we certainly do
not find it in all or many Spaniards, who are much rather
inclined to divide their attentions, or, as the impudent old
Greek definition has it, “to keep the wife for convenience and
decency, the mistress for pleasure.” Gonzales, I think, saw a
higher law.</p>

<p class='c000'>These authors, however, and others who succeeded them,
though worthy wights and good workers in labouring the lea
of Spanish criticism, in no case possess the interest which
attaches in all literatures to those who are at once eminent in
creation and careful in criticism. The place of Corneille in
French, of Jonson and Dryden in English, is taken, earlier than
any of these, by one of the great and three of the greatest writers
of Spain—Tirso de Molina, Lope, Cervantes, and Calderon.</p>

<p class='c000'>The contribution of the “creator of Don Juan” to criticism
is not large, and it comes in an odd place, but it is of importance.
In the curious medley called <span lang="es"><cite>Cigarrales</cite></span> [say "tales of
a country-house"] <span lang="es"><i>de Toledo</i></span>,<a id='r452'></a><a href='#f452' class='c019'><sup>[452]</sup></a> Tirso has included a play of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>own, <span lang="es"><cite>El Vergonzoso en Palacio</cite></span>, and has given us a discussion of
it by the company at p. 184 of the book. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Cigarrales <i>of Tirso de Molina</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> A “presumptuous
person” attacks the poet for “licentiously
deserting” the limits and laws of comedy. He has
stated the strict Unities, and is contrasting the action
of the play with them, when he is interrupted by a certain Don
Alejo, who carries the war into the enemy’s quarters bravely.
Comedy must be ended in twenty-four hours, must it? It is
quite decent and probable, is it not, that a gallant shall fall in
love with a lady, court her, treat her, win her, and marry her
all in a day? Where are all the delightful accidents of love—the
hopes and the despairs—to go? A real lover must be proved
by days and months and years of constancy. Why may not
comedy present to the eye what history presents to the understanding—much
time in little? The ingenuity of the playwright
consists [I abbreviate here a good deal] in making things
probable <em>as they are related</em>. The very difference of nature from
art is that the one, from its creation, cannot vary—a pear-tree
always producing pears, an ilex its own acorns, influenced only
by soil, climate, &#38;c. But drama varies its own laws, and grafts
tragedy on comedy. And he then boldly sets Lope, to whom
he gives the title of <span lang="es"><i>reformador de la comedia nueva</i></span>, as an example
of modern art against Æschylus and Euripides and Seneca
and Terence, explaining the dramatist’s declaration, <i>v. infra</i>,
that he had deserted the ancients to please the Popular taste,
as due only to his natural modesty. This is real plain speaking:
and the speech is worthy of the author of the <span lang="es"><cite>Burlador
de Sevilla</cite></span> and the striking <span lang="es"><cite>Condenado por Desconfiado</cite></span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tirso’s apology for his great craftsfellow was not more
superfluous than his defence of him was bold and well framed.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Lope’s</i> Arte Nuevo, <i>&#38;c.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Not merely in the verse <span lang="es"><cite>Arte Nuevo de hacer Comedias</cite></span>,<a id='r453'></a><a href='#f453' class='c019'><sup>[453]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>but elsewhere, does Lope make the somewhat undignified and
pusillanimous, but, as we have said, widely entertained,
excuse referred to. Señor Menéndez himself
can only plead (a little obviously, perhaps) that “there
were two men in Lope,” the great popular Spanish poet, and
the educated versesmith, full of academic tradition. Very
much the same mixture is seen in Dryden, from whom, as we
shall see, inconsistencies quite as great as Lope’s, and much
more numerous, can be quoted. But the contrast, I think,
brings out the characteristic weakness of the Spanish critical
spirit. Its historian admits frankly that there is a good deal
in Lope that is “infantine.” I should add that he seems to me
never to have taken any side of criticism with seriousness,
whereas Dryden successively took many. Both had to confess
that they had been sometimes traitors to their own best ideals
of poetry, to please the multitude; but Dryden, at least, never
committed the blasphemy of condemning his own best things
as Lope did, and thanking God that he himself knew the
precious “precepts,” according to which he did <em>not</em> write them.
The simple fact seems to be that a man of Lope’s extraordinary
facility and fecundity could not be critical. In the time that
Dryden took to write <cite>Alexander’s Feast</cite> the Spanish poet would
have done you an Epic, half-a-dozen plays, and minor poems
enough to fill a volume. Señor Menéndez himself avows
that he cannot pretend to be acquainted with all the critical
remarks interspersed in Lope’s enormous and never yet collected
work: and who shall venture to rival his extensive knowledge?
But we shall probably not be rash in thinking that any real doctrine,
except on details of craft, would be hard to extract from
them. The man was a genius, but not a critical genius: and it
certainly was within the resources of a very humble critical
faculty to note, as it is his chief critical glory to have noted, in
theory, as he expressed it in practice, the fact that “Points of
honour move all people mightily” on the [Spanish] stage.<a id='r454'></a><a href='#f454' class='c019'><sup>[454]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>The tractate consists of not quite 400 hendecasyllabic lines,
arranged in irregular stanzas from five to fifty lines long, and
blank except for the last two lines of each stanza, which form a
rhymed couplet. It has a rather erudite air at first sight; but
M. Morel-Fatio has ruthlessly shown that almost all, if not all,
the passages which give it this appearance are translated literally
from Robortello<a id='r455'></a><a href='#f455' class='c019'><sup>[455]</sup></a> or from Donatus. It begins by a complimentary
address to the Academy of Madrid, which had, it seems,
asked the poet for the treatise, and then passes into the slightly
ignoble apology-boast, already referred to, as to his own knowledge
of the <span lang="fr"><i>preceptos</i></span> and the barbarism, the <span lang="fr"><i>rudeza</i></span>, of the
established and popular notion of drama. He defines comedy as
imitating actions and manners of men—not royal and lofty
actions like tragedy, but humble and plebeian—gives an exceedingly
perfunctory sketch of Spanish, and a much fuller one
of ancient, drama, and then relapses into his exercises and denunciations

Naaman, he bows in the House of Rimmon by admitting that
the Unity of Time <em>must</em> be broken, though you are to hide the
breach if you can. Minor details of dramaturgy fill a large
part of the piece, with an especial recommendation of keeping
the interest of the audience on the tenterhooks. But he cannot

<p class='c008'>without another ungracious fling at the “vulgarity” and the
“barbarism” of the Muse he serves, and a confession, in
which some have seen humour, that all the 483, “except six,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>sin gravely against true art. Certainly humour is not an
unknown quality with Spaniards; but it cannot be said that,
if Lope uses it here, he uses it gracefully.</p>

<p class='c000'>Still Lope, if not very critical himself, was the cause of some
noteworthy criticism from others. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His assailants and defenders.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> From the lively controversy
which arose over the character of his work, Señor
Menéndez has extracted some documents, so exceedingly
rare, that in one instance, at any rate,
they consist of a unique copy of a reply to a libel, the original
of which has perished altogether. This is the <span lang="la"><cite>Expostulatio
Spongiæ</cite></span> (1618) (the original and lost attack on Lope having
been called <span lang="la"><cite>Spongia</cite></span>), by a Julius Columbarius, who seems to
have been the shadow of several gentlemen at once, the chief
of them Lope’s friend, Francesco López de Aguilar. Appended
to this is a dissertation by Alfonso Sanchez, professor of
Hebrew at Alcalá, in which the clear method and universally
intelligible Latin of the schools are utilised to put part of the
Romantic case, as it was seldom put before the end of the
eighteenth century. “Nature,” says Sanchez, “gives laws; she
does not accept them.” Spaniards are men, and, for the matter
of that, Roman citizens as well. And times change: and, for all
our worship of Cicero, he would be a dinner-bell<a id='r456'></a><a href='#f456' class='c019'><sup>[456]</sup></a> if he orated
in the Theatre of Alcalá. Let poetry follow the requirements
of its time. Another of these documents is the Apology for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>Spanish drama, prefixed to a collection of plays by Valencian
authors in 1616, and signed by Ricardo de[l] Turia, a <span lang="fr"><i>nom de
guerre</i></span> not yet certainly identified, which is a special defence of
Spanish comedy (<i>i.e.</i>, “drama”) as such.</p>

<p class='c000'>In face of these remarkable utterances (which could be
multiplied greatly, and the answers to them supplied) it may
seem hard, if not altogether unjustifiable, to limit
the importance of Spanish criticism, as has been
done above. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The fight over the Spanish drama.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But it has to be observed that all this
was a merely passing, and in great part a merely
personal, literary dispute, which had no real effect. While the
great Spanish dramatists lasted, the drama was popular, and
men invented reasons to defend it. But they founded no
school, either acceptedly orthodox or strong-reasoned in its
heterodoxy: and, when the great age passed, instead of a
sounder criticism, as in Dryden’s case, founding itself upon the
results, the formal and petrifying neo-classicism of Luzán froze
all these reasonings up, just as Boileau had earlier frozen those
of the Ogiers and the Saint-Sorlins in France. If we could
validate that connection between Dryden himself and the
Spanish critics, it would be something like a Missing Link: but
we cannot.</p>

<p class='c000'>The author of <cite>Don Quixote</cite> and the author of the <span lang="es"><cite>Vida es
Sueño</cite></span> contribute more irregularly to our matter. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Cervantes and Calderon.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The chief
critical documents furnished by the former are the
long poem of the <span lang="es"><cite>Viaje del Parnaso</cite></span>, and not so
much the world-famous passage of the burning of
the romances of chivalry in Don Quixote, as the whole problem
and purpose of that immortal book itself.<a id='r457'></a><a href='#f457' class='c019'><sup>[457]</sup></a> The <span lang="es"><cite>Viaje</cite></span>,<a id='r458'></a><a href='#f458' class='c019'><sup>[458]</sup></a> putting
aside the debated question of its literary value, is rather a
disappointing book, in its allegory of the poetic ship, with
glosses for portholes, and tercets for sweeps, and its endless,
but rather pointless, citation, generally flattering, but sometimes
the reverse, of poets and poetic kinds. Both praise and blame
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>appear to be distributed very much on the principle of Miss
Edgeworth’s Frank, when he proposed to give the odd piece
of tart to good Henry, who had mended his bat, or to kind
Edward, who had lent him his ball. As for the burning
question of the <span lang="es"><i>libros de caballerías</i></span>, Cervantes was beyond all
question right in preferring <span lang="es"><cite>Amadis</cite></span> and <span lang="es"><cite>Palmerin</cite></span>; but it must
be a very matter-of-fact reader who does not see that in fact he
loved them all, however he might laugh at them. Indeed,
the scene itself (<i>D. Q.</i>, I. i. 6), though it ends in almost the
whole library being left to the untender mercies of the housekeeper
and the niece, makes constant exceptions both in favour
of the romances themselves (including even such a dubious
example as <cite>Tirante the White</cite>) and of other pieces in verse and
prose from the <cite>Diana</cite> to the <cite>Araucana</cite>. And when the subject
is taken up again much farther on (I. iv. 21) by the Canon of
Toledo, his severe strictures on the Romances as they are change
suddenly into a splendid panegyric of what they might be. This
latter passage indeed shifts into one of the most remarkable of
Cervantes’ critical deliverances, the attack (in rougher language
than Lope’s own) on “irregular” plays, and the famous and very
curious passage in which, immediately afterwards, the curate
condemns the improbabilities of the chronicle-drama in words
almost precisely similar to those which Sir Philip Sidney had
used twenty years and more earlier, and adopts the whole
“preceptist” view, with a special reference to Lope’s own compromises
and a demand for rigid licensing of plots and romances
alike, according to the principles of taste and learning, of Tully
(<span lang="la"><i>secundum Donatum</i></span>) and “eloquence.” One may entertain a
passing doubt whether the chances of <span lang="es"><cite>Don Quixote</cite></span> itself would
have been altogether happy under such a censorship; and in
this there is probably more following of the Italians<a id='r459'></a><a href='#f459' class='c019'><sup>[459]</sup></a> than
deliberate critical preference. It, however, and other things
(the famous contention that epics may be written in prose as
well as in verse, though important from its actual illustration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>in the <span lang="es"><cite>Don</cite></span> and its effect on Fielding, is in no sense original, and
as an opinion hardly more than an echo of Scaliger) no doubt
give Cervantes a certain status. But Calderon can hardly be
said to give us anything except the odd inconsistency (to be
paralleled, though in a different kind, with Lope’s) of his
alternate ridicule and patronage of the Gongorist style.</p>

<p class='c000'>This last name introduces us to another controversy, which,
though connected in the most intimate way with our subject,
is a sort of appendix to it, and one of those appendices
which, in some cases, one must ruthlessly
cut short. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Gongorism, Culteranism, &#38;c.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The quarrels over Lope (whom, by the
way, Góngora himself savagely attacked) were succeeded by the
battle of <span lang="es"><i>culteranismo</i></span>, again distinguished by that curious see-sawing
which, as we have seen, marks the Spaniards on almost all
critical points. Quevedo, for instance, and the above-mentioned
Gonzales de Salas, behave like those capricious knights of
Spenser’s, who were always changing sides in the battle, and
running tilt at the very champions by whose side they had
lately charged. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Quevedo.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Quevedo in particular has a most extraordinary
record in this matter. I do not think that, in my
limited reading of Spanish, I have ever laughed
more over anything than over his <span lang="es"><cite>Cuento de Cuentos</cite></span>,<a id='r460'></a><a href='#f460' class='c019'><sup>[460]</sup></a> and his
<cite>Catechism to help to translate the jargonizing ladies</cite>, where he
addresses himself <span lang="it"><i>Al caro, diáfano, transparente e mediano
Lector</i></span>, gives instructions in the best manner of precious speech,
and advises that a wife should call her husband <span lang="es"><i>mi quotidio</i></span>,
and he her <span lang="la"><i>su sempiterna</i></span>, while neither will dream of speaking
of a “gota <span lang="es"><i>de agua</i></span>,” but will, of course, denominate it a
<span lang="es"><i>podagra</i></span>. Yet Quevedo at other times did more than condescend
to cultism, or culteranism, as it seems to be indifferently
called.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Gracián.</i></div>

<p class='c000'>The great prose apostle of the cult, as Góngora was its poet,
was Balthasar Gracián, who has not a little for us in his famous
<span lang="es"><cite>Agudeza y arte de ingenio</cite></span>,<a id='r461'></a><a href='#f461' class='c019'><sup>[461]</sup></a> the Bible of preciosity,
with its motto, <span lang="es"><i>En Nada Vulgar</i></span>, and its doctrine
(II. 49), that <span lang="es"><i>La semejança es origen de una immensidad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>conceptuosa tirar principio de agudeza sin limite</i></span>. His name
gives an opportunity of illustrating the difficulty of treating
<span lang="es"><i>cosas de España</i></span>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The limitations of Spanish criticism.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
I am not aware of any living
English authorities on Spanish literature who can
be placed above Mr David Hannay and Mr Fitzmaurice
Kelly. Of these, the first says<a id='r462'></a><a href='#f462' class='c019'><sup>[462]</sup></a> that it
was Gracián’s “chosen function to be the critic, prophet, and
populariser of Gongorism”; the second,<a id='r463'></a><a href='#f463' class='c019'><sup>[463]</sup></a> that “No man ever
wrote ... with more scorn of Gongorism and all its work.”
Who shall decide when doctors of this degree disagree to this
extent? I am, so far as my very poor and imperfect knowledge
of the texts goes, with Mr Hannay: but that is not to the
point.</p>

<p class='c000'>What, I think, is to the point, and what I may say with
some general knowledge of criticism, if with little particular
knowledge of Spanish, is that the very nature of the subject
invites, excuses, necessitates such differences. The Spaniards,
if I may be pardoned a rough and ugly metaphor, never
“digested themselves,” never either kept creation and criticism
separate, or waited for the one till the other had ceased.
<span lang="es"><cite>Naturaleza</cite></span> and <span lang="es"><cite>Agudeza</cite></span> jostle each other constantly in them,
with a result of truceless war. One may even wonder whether
<em>cultismo</em>, <span lang="es"><i>culteranismo</i></span>, <span lang="es"><i>conceptismo</i></span>,<a id='r464'></a><a href='#f464' class='c019'><sup>[464]</sup></a> coming as they did after the
great period of natural freedom, in Lope, and Tirso, and Cervantes
at his best, did not do far more than the harm that the much-abused
“Metaphysicals” did in English. The practice of Góngora
and Gracián, even of Calderon, not seldom belied the arguments
of Tirso and of the shadowy Turia and Sanchez. When
a Luzán comes in such cases it is too fatally easy for him to say,
“Well! whatever the ancients did, they did not do <em>this</em>! There
is at any rate no <span lang="es"><i>jerigonza</i></span> in Aristotle or in Horace!” And the
Spaniards had no Milton, no Shakespeare to carry them through,
as ours carried us through the worst times. Their Cervantes in
his great work was of an “off” kind, as yet not fully recognised;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>their Lope was too fluent, facile, voluminous, unconvincing;
their Calderon, with all his marvellous poetical and specially
lyrical power, too unequal and perhaps too rhetorical.</p>

<p class='c000'>Above all, they had the misfortune to have no critic of real
authority. The <span lang="es"><cite>Arte Nuevo</cite></span> is partly clever enough “technical
education,” partly bookwork, partly ignoble or inartistic compromise:
and if we compare Tasso and Lope, at no such great
distance of time, we can only be struck by the enormous advantage
of the Italian in serious critical weight. The others, the
Pincianos, the Gonzales de Salas, and the rest, were persons, if
not exactly of no mark or likelihood, at any rate of no commanding
and authoritative importance, like Ben Jonson and Dryden
in England, like Boileau in France. Even such comparatively
slight examination of the actual texts as I have been able to give
has shown me that many most interesting and independently
striking <span lang="fr"><i>aperçus</i></span>, passages, phrases may be taken from the
Spanish critics. But I cannot say that, even after duly perusing
and perpending the admirably competent and loving examination
of Señor Menéndez, I have been able to form any high
opinion of Spanish seventeenth-century criticism as a whole.</p>

the <span lang="es"><cite>Historia de las Ideas Estéticas en

This is fortunate for me, inasmuch
as I do not pretend to any
extensive familiarity with Spanish
literature beyond the early poets,
and indeed do not read the language
with very great facility. Besides
Señor Menéndez I have relied chiefly
on the texts and comments recently
furnished (<i>v. inf.</i>) by M. Morel-Fatio
(who will, I hope, continue in so good a
road), on Ticknor, on the short but valuable
notices of this period in Mr Spingarn,
<i>op. cit.</i>, on those in my friend Mr
Hannay’s <cite>The Later Renaissance</cite> (Edinburgh
and London, 1898), and on Mr
James Fitzmaurice Kelly’s <cite>History of
Spanish Literature</cite> (London, 1898). I
am particularly obliged to Mr Kelly for
a copy of the recent (undated) Spanish
translation of his book, with a few corrections,
and a preface by Señor Menéndez
himself. The Spanish critic
combines, with a just praise of the
book, a mild remonstrance as to the
small space which Mr Fitzmaurice
Kelly has given to this very critical
subject—a fact in which I own I myself
had felt some comfort. The
silence of the specialist is the shield of
the expatiator. I have not failed,
wherever I could, to verify all the
critical deliverances in the text, and
examine almost all, if not all, the
books mentioned; but I do not know
the <em>circumference</em> of them as I do elsewhere.
And as I began this History
on the principle of going to the sources,
I think myself bound to warn the reader
of any case in which I have been obliged
to modify that principle.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f428'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r428'>428</a>. This was written before M. Morel-Fatio
had expressed the same view in
his <span lang="fr"><cite>Les Défenseurs de la Comedia</cite></span> (<span lang="fr"><cite>Bulletin
Hispanique</cite></span>, <i>ubi cit. inf.</i>) See
also on the point Mr Ker’s <cite>Essays
of Dryden</cite>, i. lxvi, and the references
in his index to Dryden’s mention of
Spanish plays. Of course the main interest
of the matter lies in the much
stronger resemblances that exist between
the great English and Spanish
dramas than between any other two
national branches of the European
theatre.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f429'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r429'>429</a>. They say now that he was not only
not (as used to be said) the premier
and only Marquis of Spain, but not a
Marquis at all. <span lang="la"><i>Non moror: non sum

will probably restore the Marquisate.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f430'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r430'>430</a>. I have duly looked this up in what
appears to be the only accessible place
(a place valuable for other documents),
the <span lang="es"><cite>Orígenes de La Lengua Española</cite></span>,
Madrid, 1737, of Mayáns y Siscar. It
is merely a tissue of troubadours’
names, scholastic citations, and minute
details of pronunciation and versification.
Señor Menéndez has reprinted
part of it in the Appendix to his second
volume.</p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f433'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r433'>433</a>. I have used the somewhat later
Grenville copy in the British Museum
Salamanca, 1509, fol.; and Señor
Menéndez' reprint in the Appendix to
his second volume, which also contains
one or two other early documents.</p>

In 1860 a better text appeared at Madrid
with the singular, which Ticknor
and Mr Kelly approve. For any one
who professes no Spanish scholarship
to set himself against these authorities
may seem absurd. But in the book
itself <span lang="la"><cite>sub finem</cite></span> the author writes
“<span lang="es">habiendo considerado <em>estas tres lenguas</em></span>,”
and the changes are rung on
Latin, Tuscan, and Spanish throughout.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f435'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r435'>435</a>. After a conversation with Navagero

its way, also a critical document.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f436'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r436'>436</a>. Señor Menéndez refers to two
<cite>Poetics</cite> anterior to Rengifo, neither of
which I have seen. The first, by Miguel
Sanchez de Lima (sometimes called de
Viana), Alcala, 1580, has a slight interest
in the wording of its title, “<span lang="es"><cite>El
Arte Poética</cite></span> en romance castillano.”
The second—which from its date (1593)
would seem to be a little later than
Rengifo, though the historian mentions
it first—is Hierónymo de Mondragon’s
<span lang="es"><cite>Arte para componer en metro castillano</cite></span>
(Saragossa, 1593).</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f437'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r437'>437</a>. The above paragraph was written
from notes taken while reading Rengifo
at the British Museum.  In subsequently
reading Señor Menéndez on
him I was surprised to find the learned
historian protesting against the Labyrinth,
and other such things, as having
been foisted in <i>cir.</i> 1700-1720, and referring
to the editions of 1592 and 1606 as
alone genuine. But the British Museum
copy is that of 1606!  Let it by us
even be said to Rengifo’s credit that,
like Sidney, he felt the charm of old
romance. See M. y P., p. 320.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f438'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r438'>438</a>. “The inexorable Cascales,” as Señor
Menéndez calls him in a passage which
I had not read when I wrote the text.
Of Cascales, as of Pinciano (<i>v. infra</i>),
the Señor thinks far more highly than
I do. Both seem to me (though Cascales
more than Pinciano) to be simply
uncompromising Aristotelians who borrowed
from the Italians; but, like most
borrowers and imitators, hardened and
emphasised what they borrowed. Both
were forced to allow little “easements”
in regard to the drama; but only such
as are consistent with Aristotle’s text,
though not with some glosses on him.
And Pinciano simply translates the
Aristotelian definition of tragedy, while
Cascales, doubtless with reference to
the different heresies of Castelvetro
and Giraldi, is quite Athanasian in
his doctrine that poetic verities are
absolutely unchangeable, and independent
of custom and time.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f439'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r439'>439</a>. The book appeared in 1616; but I
have had to use the reprint of 1779. I
have not seen Mesa’s <span lang="es"><cite>Compendio de la
Poética</cite></span> (Madrid, 1607) or Carillo’s
<span lang="es"><cite>Libro de Erudicion poética</cite></span>.</p>

rare, and does not appear to be in the
British Museum either under “Pinciano”
or under Lopez, his real name.
Fortunately there is a recent reprint
(Valladolid, 1894), ed. by Professor
Don Pedro Muñoz Peña, which I duly
possess.  It may be observed that
bibliographers and librarians are particularly
hard on the laity in the
Spanish department. It is surely needless
to make one hunt in vain for an
author of world-wide reputation under
his world-name till one runs him to
earth as <i>Gómez de</i> Quevedo [<i>y</i>] <i>Villegas</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r442'>442</a>. Señor Peña, himself a professor

was taken by distinguished <span lang="la"><i>alumni</i></span> of
that University, and derived from the
Roman city (Pincia) supposed to have
existed on the site.  Few definite
dates or facts seem to be known about
Alfonso Lopez, except that he was physician
to Mary of Austria, daughter of
Charles V. and widow of Maximilian II.
during her life at Madrid from 1576 to
1603, and that he wrote, besides the

according to a wise habit of its own
in such cases (cf. Capriano), has two
copies, and M. Morel-Fatio has included
the piece which concerns us in an
invaluable collection (also including
Lope’s <span lang="es"><cite>Arte Nuevo</cite></span> and other things) of
Spanish critical documents, which he
is issuing in the <span lang="es"><cite>Bulletin Hispanique</cite></span>

parts, both in Latin and Spanish.
R. de[l] Turia, <i>infra</i>, has been reprinted,
but the marrow of him also will be
found in the <span lang="es"><cite>Historia</cite></span>, as well as much
else: for instance, an interesting
<span lang="es"><cite>Invectiva y Apologia</cite></span>, by Francesco de
la Barreda in 1622, which is dignified
by the words: “There was no greater
dramatic-poetic written in the seventeenth
century”—a large statement.
But Barreda is certainly a staunch anti-Unitarian,
and has well reached the
important doctrine that “Art is merely
a careful observation of classified [<span lang="es"><i>graduados</i></span>]
examples.” The whole dispute,
in which the more or less great names
of the Argensolas, Artieda, Cristóbal
de Mesa, and others, figure, together
with the subsequent one on <em>culteranism</em>,
will be found exhaustively treated
in the tenth chapter of the <span lang="es"><cite>Historia</cite></span>,
and more summarily, but still usefully,
in Ticknor. Since most of the text
was written M. Morel-Fatio, in his
<span lang="es"><cite>Défenseurs de la Comedia</cite></span> (<i>v. sup.</i>, p.
343), has subjoined Turia to Tirso,
and a certain Carlos Boyl to both, adding
a notice of the Frenchman Ogier (<i>v.
sup.</i>, pp. 256, 257), who is already familiar
to readers of these pages. Boyl, one
of the Valencian group above referred
to, wrote in “romance” form rules of
the <span lang="es"><i>comedia nueva</i></span>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f457'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r457'>457</a>. Let it be remembered that the

but from the spurious and intrusive
work of the mysterious Avellaneda.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r458'>458</a>. Enthusiastically Englished, with

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f459'>

as Pinciano and Cascales. This opinion,
formed independently from reading of
<span lang="es"><cite>Don Quixote</cite></span>, agrees with one of much
more importance, that of Señor Menéndez
himself. Nay, Mr Fitzmaurice

Cervantes “the least critical
of men.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It is not necessary to add much to what has been said in the

to indicate the reasons why the growth of criticism
in Germany, High and Low,<a id='r465'></a><a href='#f465' class='c019'><sup>[465]</sup></a> was far more tardy, and
for a long time far scantier, than even in England; and why,
when it came, it displayed a one-eyed character which is not
visible in any other of the great European countries.<a id='r466'></a><a href='#f466' class='c019'><sup>[466]</sup></a> <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The hindmost of all.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Want of
unity, religious and political troubles, Grobianism and its opposite
or companion Pedantry—all had to do with this; but the
principal hindrance was the non-existence of any considerable
German vernacular literature, and the consequent inveteracy
of the habit of writing in Latin. So long as this lasted the
Germans and Dutch might be and were commentators, scholars,
grammarians—but they could hardly be critics, because they
still lacked the comparative stimulus. And it is not a little
noteworthy that the earlier development of Criticism in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>Low Countries as compared with Germany, during our present
period, at least coincided with a greater development of Dutch
vernacular literature, though this is a matter which lies out of
our direct route.</p>

<p class='c000'>There may easily be differences of opinion as to the persons,
not mere Humanists, who shall be selected as representing the
beginning of German criticism in modern times, in
so far at least as the section of Poetics is concerned.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Origins.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The choice may lie between the famous Johann Sturm, who
touches on literary matters in his letters, who wrote on Rhetoric,
and whose pupil, late in his life, drew up a commentary on the
Epistle to the Pisos in 1576; Georgius Fabricius, of Chemnitz,
the first form of whose <span lang="la"><cite>De Re Poetica</cite></span> appeared in 1565; and
Jacobus Pontanus, whose real name was Spanmüller, whose book
on the subject was published thirty years later, but who, as he
was then a man of over fifty, and had long been a professor,
had probably dealt with the subject, if only in lectures, much
earlier.<a id='r467'></a><a href='#f467' class='c019'><sup>[467]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Sturm’s interests were more in pædagogy than in poetry,
and he does not rank high as a critic: though there is no doubt
that he helped to spread devotion to books. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Sturm.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It is not
in his favour that, in the teeth of both external and
internal evidence, he fights<a id='r468'></a><a href='#f468' class='c019'><sup>[468]</sup></a> for the name <span lang="la"><cite>De Arte Poetica</cite></span>, on the
special ground that the work of Horace is an <span lang="la"><cite>Ars Perfecta</cite></span>
(which, put its merits as high as you please, it most certainly
is <em>not</em>), and that it has all the six parts of poetry—fable, character,
<i>dianoia</i>, <i>lexis</i>, <i>melopœia</i>, and “sight.” For the rest he
has few general remarks, and is almost wholly commentatorial.
His Rhetorical writing yields little really critical: nor in his
<cite>Letters</cite> have I yet found half so much criticism as is extant
in that single letter of Ascham to him, which has been noticed
above.<a id='r469'></a><a href='#f469' class='c019'><sup>[469]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The other two were both men of very wide influence as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>teachers of Poetics: and both underwent the process—complimentary
but disfiguring, and specially usual in the
late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries—of having
their work watered out, or boiled down, by others. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Fabricius.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> I do not
know, and I have not considered it <span lang="it"><i>tanti</i></span> to spend much time or
labour in the attempt to discover, the exact process by which the
small four books of the first edition of Fabricius’ <span lang="la"><cite>De Re Poetica</cite></span><a id='r470'></a><a href='#f470' class='c019'><sup>[470]</sup></a>
became the fat volume of seven, which presents itself under
the same title thirty years later.<a id='r471'></a><a href='#f471' class='c019'><sup>[471]</sup></a> <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Version A.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It seemed better to give this
time and labour to the reading of the books themselves.
Version A (as we may call that of 1565) is an early
example of the kind of <span lang="la"><i>gradus</i></span> which was particularly
popular among the northern nations, though, as we have seen
from the work of Mazzone da Miglionico,<a id='r472'></a><a href='#f472' class='c019'><sup>[472]</sup></a> it was by no means
unknown in Italy. In his first book Fabricius discusses
quantity, metre, and diction in general, with plentiful
examples. Book II. is an elaborate table of locutions from
the Latin poets, listed under heads as thus:—</p>

<p class='c030'>Book III. provides the dull-witted versifier with store of <span lang="fr"><i>clichés</i></span>
of the same kind, but a little more elaborate; there being, for
instance, dozens of phrases for embracing. And IV. is a sort of
common place-book of short copies of verses on everything in
Heaven and Earth.</p>

<p class='c000'>Version B (which is dated long after Fabricius’ death in
1571) is not only much enlarged but differently arranged.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Version B.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Book I. deals as before with Quantity and Feet;
Book II. with the subject of A, Book III.; and the
rest follow the same schemes,—III. B with tags on Ages,
Seasons, Heavenly Bodies, &#38;c.; IV. with epithets suitable to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>proper names; V. with ditto to common; VI. with a <span lang="fr"><i>pot-pourri</i></span>
of poetical faults and beauties, &#38;c.; while VII. gives a sort of
appendix on prosody and diction generally.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is no need to say much on the inevitable critical
result, the obvious critical value or valuelessness, of this. There
is in A a reference to Scaliger’s <cite>Poetic</cite>, which had appeared a
little before. As a matter of fact Scaliger and Fabricius between
them provided the average late sixteenth-century man—sometimes
even when he was a professed critic or poet, constantly
when he was merely a person of ordinary culture—with a sort
of joint poetical Thesaurus,—Scaliger doing the historical,
critical, and (of its kind) philosophical business for him, and
Fabricius keeping a general marine-store of materials, with
precepts for their use.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <span lang="la"><cite>Institutiones Poeticæ</cite></span> of Spanmüller [Pontanus] appeared
first in 1594. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Jac. Pontanus.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Its author is quoted, among other prophets
of criticism, by the Spaniard Juan de La Cueva a
dozen years later, and, independently of its original
form, the book acquired, early in the seventeenth century, a
large currency by being arranged (<span lang="la"><i>concinnata</i></span>) in the <span lang="la"><cite>Sacrarum
Profanarumque Phraseum Thesaurus</cite></span> of J. Buehler,<a id='r473'></a><a href='#f473' class='c019'><sup>[473]</sup></a> where it
serves as theoretic handbook to another Gradus. Indeed
Pontanus’ own work has all the characteristics of a decoction
or abstract of Scaliger himself. And once more the same
reflection applies. It is impossible not to see how powerful
and (beyond mere school-work, in which they were no doubt
invaluable<a id='r474'></a><a href='#f474' class='c019'><sup>[474]</sup></a>) how maleficent must have been the influence
of such works on the critical temper of the generations influenced
by them. La Bruyère’s <span lang="fr"><cite>Tout est dit</cite></span>—an ironical fling
in its author’s mouth partly, no doubt, though perhaps not quite
so even there—tended to become matter of breviary. Everything
had been said and done; all the Kinds found out; all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>the phrases set down; all the poetry raised from shaft and
vein and seam. You simply rearranged it like a child’s house
of wooden bricks, according to patterns provided on the lid.
The “Causes of Corrupted Arts” into which Vives inquired,
“The Lost System of Speaking” which Sturm deplored, were
all to be found, and found sufficiently, in the Ancients.</p>

<p class='c000'>The solid qualities of the German race have not commonly
distinguished themselves in pure criticism, and to this day
Lessing and Goethe are rather captains without companies,
and with at best a staff of Schlegels, and suchlike, for
lieutenants and ancients. Germans were, however, to do something
better, in this century of erudition, than the mere preparation
of fourth-form handbooks. Daniel Heinsius and
Gerard Voss may be regarded with some reason as the Jachin
and the Boaz of the temple of seventeenth-century Poetics.
<i>The <span lang="la">De Tragœdiæ Constitutione</span></i> of the first, which appeared at
Leyden in 1611,<a id='r475'></a><a href='#f475' class='c019'><sup>[475]</sup></a> is the succinctest and best argued statement
of the neo- and to a great extent pseudo-Aristotelian view
of Drama. The new <cite>Institutes of Oratory</cite>,<a id='r476'></a><a href='#f476' class='c019'><sup>[476]</sup></a> and the much later
<cite>Poetical Institutes</cite><a id='r477'></a><a href='#f477' class='c019'><sup>[477]</sup></a> of the second, construct, with a great deal
of learning and a very considerable amount of good sense, an
entire neo-classical Rhetoric and Poetic. To both we must
give some attention.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <span lang="la"><cite>De Tragœdiæ Constitutione</cite></span> is beyond all doubt a very
remarkable book. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Heinsius. The</i> De Tragœdiæ Constitutione.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It is quite short; only some 250 very small
pages of very large print, so that there are scarcely
more than a hundred words in a page. But
Heinsius writes as one having authority; and we
can read but little of him before it becomes perfectly
clear why that authority was accepted, for the rest of
the century at least, with more docility and less cavil than that
of almost any other critic. He takes the <cite>Poetics</cite>—as many,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>indeed most men for more than half a century, had taken them—for
gospel. But he neither translates them on the one hand, nor
wanders in the wilderness of scrappy and desultory commentary
on the other. Not merely does he confine himself to that part
of the book which concerns his actual subject, but he renders
this part in a fashion which may best be described as a very
rare, and very masterly, kind of lecturing. He neither slavishly
keeps nor prudishly avoids the actual words of his author; his
paraphrases are brief but lucid; he adds to Aristotle what
he thinks necessary<a id='r478'></a><a href='#f478' class='c019'><sup>[478]</sup></a> in the way of illustrations from the Greek
tragedians, citation from Horace, examples (by no means always
laudatory) from Seneca, and the like; but in such a fashion
as never to overload, or water down, the milk of the Aristotelian
word. That he always gives that milk quite “sincere” we
cannot say; he emphasises the “single revolution of the sun”
more than he has any right to do, though he does not do the
same for the still more pestilent and apocryphal Unity of
Place. He may sometimes, or often in the disputable places
(as of “purgation” and so forth), miss the full meaning of
Aristotle according to the view of some judges, or impute a
wrong one according to others. But nobody, let it be repeated,
can read him impartially without seeing that he has soaked
himself with the spirit of his author, has equipped himself
pretty thoroughly with the literature of his subject, and, as
a result, is speaking, as we said, with authority. There is no
clearer or more workmanlike exposition of the neo-classic,
and not too <em>neo</em>-classic, dramatic ideal than his.</p>

<p class='c000'>Heinsius, like his successor Hédelin in France, and like
Hédelin’s successors Rymer and Dennis in England, was rash
enough to forget that though a critic is (thank
Heaven!) not bound to write good poetry, he is bound
not to publish bad. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Voss.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> And he ventured on a tragedy, <span lang="es"><cite>Herodes
Infanticida</cite></span>, and other things which did not meet much quarter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>even from those who agreed with him in critical principles.
Voss was wiser, and confined himself to the pure erudition and
comment of which the two books referred to above are far from
being the worst examples. Indeed his unboastful scholarship,
his immense reading, and his untiring industry would seem to
have fitted him quite exceptionally for the duty; and he has
actually given us in these two books, or rather collections of
books, the completest <cite>Rhetoric</cite> and <cite>Poetic</cite> of modern, if not of
any, times. Only two things more were needed to put these
books in a place even more unique; but Nature refused the
one to Voss personally, and the other was a thing almost
unreasonable to require from a Dutch savant of the seventeenth
century. The first was positive critical genius; and
the second was an impartial appreciation of ancient and modern
literature.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>His</i> Rhetoric.</div>

<p class='c000'>The <cite>Rhetoric</cite>, which the author put out in its first form in
1606, revising and enlarging it for at least thirty years, till it
forms a quarto of a thousand closely printed pages,
has some seventy more of minute index, but lacks
the Table of Contents, or displayed syllabus of section headings,
for which we have so often had to be thankful in Italian
work. Voss evidently had the practice of the Roman Law constantly
before him, and he thus follows the method of the Latin
treatises in a way which makes it for the most part superfluous
for us to follow <em>him</em>, though he has plenty of modern instances
and applications. From the Fourth Book onwards,
however, he deals with Elocution and Style, chiefly of course by
the way of Figures, yet, according to his lights, in the most
careful and exhaustive fashion. But what is at once noteworthy
and rather tell-tale is his unqualified admiration for
the Scaligers,—father and son. “That divine man,” “that
man, <span lang="la"><i>ad unguem factus</i></span>,” that “emperor of the literary world,”
that “prince of the senate of criticism”; without some phrase
of this kind he seems unable to name them. And in fact the
whole book is rather a huge commentatorial digest of what they
and others, from Aristotle downwards, have said than anything
more.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <cite>Poetical Institutions</cite> are somewhat more original, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>they had much greater influence. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His</i> Poetics.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The book consists really
of three separate works, a brief <span lang="la"><cite>De Arte Poetica</cite></span> of
less than ninety pages, of which Grotius, in a commendatory
epigram prefixed to some editions, says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="la">non magnus dat tibi cuncta liber;</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>of the <span lang="la"><cite>Institutiones</cite></span> proper in about four hundred; and of a <span lang="la"><cite>De
Imitatione</cite></span> which is rather shorter than the <span lang="la"><cite>Ars</cite></span>. The first, as
reason and its title both import, is a purely general tractate,
which, after pointing out that Poetry has much in common
with Oratory, and that therefore much which concerns it has
been said in the earlier book, discusses all the old generalities
about the origin, nature, moral character, and so forth, of poetry,
with expositions of most of the <span lang="la"><i>cruces</i></span> and technical catchwords
from Ψιλὸς λόγος down to <span lang="la"><i>furor poeticus</i></span>. Voss is here also
very generally Scaligerian; he adheres to the “natural” origin
of poetry, love-songs, cradle-songs, &#38;c., as against the religious
and the deliberately “imitative”; gives very wide scope of subject
to the poet, and defends him handsomely against his enemies
and detractors from Plato downwards, but is properly
indignant with naughty poets.<a id='r479'></a><a href='#f479' class='c019'><sup>[479]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The <cite>Institutions</cite> deal more directly with the question of
Poetic Art, and proceed by a series of section-headings in the
form of Propositions, which are then explained, commented,
and defended. The first of the Three Books deals with the
matter common to all kinds of poetry; the Second with the
Drama; the Third with the Epic and the minor Kinds. All
this is old stuff rehandled. There is somewhat more originality
in the <span lang="la"><cite>De Imitatione</cite></span>, which does not exactly correspond to
any of the older books, or parts of books, on that subject. Voss
generally supposes the question, “How is the poet to set about
his work?” “How is he to apply all these rules that we have
given him?” and before very long we see that he is really
thinking of the wrong Imitation no less than Vida was. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>devotes himself (no doubt under the happier inspiration of
Quintilian) to discussing <em>how</em> we are to imitate, how to read.
But he very soon slips into the inquiry, practical indeed
but a little undignified, “How are we to escape plagiarism?”
to which one is tempted to reply, “By not imitating in this
sense at all.” That is not his opinion. He thinks, if we may
vary a well-known proverb, that the safe way is to take all your
eggs out of one basket. But you are never to imitate bad
words and thoughts; you must plan your work carefully beforehand,
correct carefully, invite criticism, but distinguish
between what is good and what is not. It is all very just
in this way; but that way has led us far from <span lang="la"><i>furor poeticus</i></span>.
We feel at the end of Voss’s laborious and erudite book
that we are indeed in the century of the <span lang="la"><i>Gradus</i></span>. And
here, as in his other volume, we also feel that he has, for
good or for evil, caught up and uttered the gospel of Neo-Classicism.</p>

<p class='c000'>So far we have dealt only with Latin authors. The work of
Heinsius is mentioned, both in the text by the author, and
by the introducer, Augustinus Iskra, of the <span lang="de"><cite>Buch
von der Deutschen Poeterei</cite></span><a id='r480'></a><a href='#f480' class='c019'><sup>[480]</sup></a> of Martin Opitz. <span class='sni side4'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Opitz.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> This
interesting and agreeable little book, though not exactly (as it
has sometimes been incorrectly called) the first<a id='r481'></a><a href='#f481' class='c019'><sup>[481]</sup></a> piece of German
poetic in the vernacular, is entitled, with the usual reserves,
to the place of origin in <em>modern</em> German Poetics. It cannot be
called prolix, for it only occupies sixty pages in the recent
reprint; but it is equally modest and business-like, and helps to
redeem from the utter absurdity of most of such appellations
(though it still remains absurd) the title of German Dryden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>which somebody or other has given to Opitz. Augustine Iskra
does not exaggerate when he says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="la">Altius scandes patria canendo</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la">Barbyto, quam si Latium peritæ</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la">Atticæ jungas, Syriæque Peithus</span></div>
      <div class='line in10'><span lang="la">Noveris artem.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>And it is the peculiar glory of the Silesian poet that he not
only sang himself on the lyre of his country, but did his best to
enable others to do so. The spirit of genuine patriotism breathes
in his dedication of the booklet to the magistrates of his native
town, Buntzlau; and that of a modest scholarship (an adjective
and substantive which make such an agreeable couple that it is
pity they should live so much apart) in the opening of the book
itself. He has not the least idea, he says, that you can make a
poet by rules and laws; nor has he any intention of doing over
again the work which Aristotle, Horace, Vida, and Scaliger
have done. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> <span lang="de">Buch der Deustchen Poeterei</span>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But he arrays himself (to speak ecclesiastically) in
a “decent tippet” of the old stuff about Linus and Orpheus,
with the Strabo passage all complete, and a train of
citations as to the nobility of the poet’s office and the
like. He comes in his fourth chapter to business.
He actually quotes Walther von der Vogelweide; and
I do not think that he can be fairly charged with that ὕβρις towards
the ancient poetry of his country which too frequently marks
others in other countries. But he is evidently set on the work
of Reform—of substituting “smoothness of numbers” for the
“wild sweetness” of the folk-song. Wherein no doubt he was
wrong. Not that way did the counsels of perfection lie for the
Higher Dutch; and they have always had to come back to the
woodnotes and the wood-Muses to find poetic luck. But Opitz
was entitled—was in his day almost bound—to think differently.
The interesting thing—much more interesting to us than the
details to which it led him, such as the patronage of the Alexandrine,
the alternation of masculine and feminine rhymes, &#38;c.—is
the particular source to which he turned for inspiration
and guidance. He knew, as has been said, the Italian critics,
at least those in Latin, and he probably knew the Italian poets
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>(he cites Petrarch). But it is to France, and specially to Ronsard,
that he fondly turns. Now it need hardly be said that in
1624 the influence of the Pléiade in its own country, though
not quite dead, was moribund; the correctness of Malherbe, on
the one hand, was doing its best deliberately to throttle it, and
the Italianated and Spaniolated extravagances which were fashionable
were choking it in another way. This is no doubt not
the only instance of a literary influence which is dead or dying
in its own country showing full vitality in another, but it is one
of the most remarkable. For, beyond question, the French
influence—in successive forms, but still French—reigned in
Germany for some hundred and fifty years; and it was Opitz
who first brought it to bear.</p>

<p class='c000'>His details, as has been said, are less interesting: yet they
do not lack interest. He begins by stickling for pure High
German: and certainly no one who, for his sins, has been condemned
to read much of late fifteenth- and early sixteenth-century
German—one of the ugliest and most mongrel speeches
in history, and quite astounding after the musical sweetness of
the best <span lang="de"><i>Mittelhochdeutsch</i></span>—will owe him a grudge for this. He
protests against the mingle-mangle of foreign words which was
flooding the language, and even against the famous <em>-iren</em> by
which, to the present day to some extent, Germans give a sort
of spurious naturalisation to such foreigners. He would have
limits set (though he does not forbid it altogether) to that odd
custom of declining classical names in German speech, which is
also maintained to some extent, but which sometimes made a
mere Macaronic of sixteenth-century German. On the other
hand, it is curious to find him urging on Germans, who by right
were, and by practice long have been, among the busiest and most
successful of word-compounders, the <span lang="de"><i>sonderliche anmuthigkeit</i></span>
of compounds: and actually quoting the French as, next the
Greeks, the masters of such things.<a id='r482'></a><a href='#f482' class='c019'><sup>[482]</sup></a> Of course the historical
student, even if citations from Ronsard were not on the same
page, would know at once whence this comes. Still, there
still remains the oddity of alleging the undoubtedly awkward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>and exotic-sounding <span lang="fr"><i>chasse-nue</i></span>, <span lang="fr"><i>ébranle-rocher</i></span>, and <span lang="fr"><i>irrite-mer</i></span>
as warrants and patterns for words like <span lang="de"><i>wolkentreiber</i></span>, <span lang="de"><i>felsenstürmer</i></span>,
and <span lang="de"><i>meeraufreitzer</i></span>, which simply seem to us natural-born,
and to require no warranty but their own sound and
appearance.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Opitz (of whom if any critic speaks disrespectfully, I fear
that it argues him uncritical) wrote not merely on the eve, but
in the actual stormy morning, of the Thirty Years’ War: and
Germany had something else to do for a long time besides
listening to him. When matters settled down again, the
advice to attend to the French was rather unfortunately
“carried over” to a state of things in which French influence
was still less the influence for Germany. But this imitation,
whether right or wrong, found no important critical expression,
and it would be losing labour and space to devote
either to German criticism in the last half of the seventeenth
century.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is more remarkable that the real activity and accomplishment
of Dutch during the early part of the century did not lead
to some development of vernacular criticism. But to the best
of my information<a id='r483'></a><a href='#f483' class='c019'><sup>[483]</sup></a> it did not. The Dutch and the Germans,
however, of course still continued to write in Latin, to edit, to
comment, to carry on that division of critical work which, according
to the laying out of our subject, lies, except at particular
seasons and for special ends, beyond the scope of this book.
Moreover, both Holland and some of the German Free-towns,
but especially the former country, became the adopted, as they
were almost the natural, homes of those beginners of judicial
criticism, who have been noticed in part at the conclusion of
the French chapter of this Book. Bayle’s <span lang="fr"><cite>Nouvelles de la
République de Lettres</cite></span> were Hollandish by domicile, as was the
<span lang="fr"><cite>Bibliothèque Universelle</cite></span> of Le Clerc, while at Leipsic the <span lang="la"><cite>Acta
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>Eruditorum</cite></span> maintained the same principle of critical annals
for nearly a century. Bayle, as has been said before, was too
much of a partisan, and perhaps of a wit, for anything of his
to have a judicial, however much in some senses of the word it
might have a critical, character: but the less mercurial talents
of Jean Le Clerc, which have been characterised under the
head of the <cite>Ana</cite> (v. <i>sup.</i>, p. 276), were very well suited to the
conduct of a critical record.</p>

<p class='c004'>The middle third, if not the whole first half, of the seventeenth
century in England was too much occupied with civil and religious
broils to devote attention to such a subject
literary criticism. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Dead water in English Criticism.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Between the probable date of
Jonson’s <cite>Timber</cite> (1625-37) and the certain one of
Dryden’s <cite>Essay of Dramatic Poesy</cite> (1668) we have practically
nothing substantive save the interesting prefatory matter to
<cite>Gondibert</cite> (1650). <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Milton</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Milton, the greatest man of letters
wholly of the time, must indeed during this time
have conceived, or at least matured, that cross-grained prejudice
against rhyme, which is more surprising in him than even in Campion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>and which was itself even more open to Daniel’s strictures.
For not only is Milton himself in his own practice a greater
and more triumphant vindicator of rhyme than Campion, but
Daniel’s strongest and soundest argument, “Why condemn this
thing in order to establish that?” applies far more strongly to
blank verse than to Campion’s artificial metres. Custom and
Nature, those greater Cæsars to whom Daniel so triumphantly
appealed, had already settled it, as they were to confirm it later,
that rhymed and unrhymed verse, each obeying the natural
evolution of English prosody, should be the twin horses to
draw its car. But Milton never developed his antipathy to
rhyme (which in all probability arose, mainly if not merely,
from the fact that nearly all the most exquisite rhymers
of his time, except himself, were Cavaliers) in any critical
fashion, contenting himself with occasional flings and <span lang="la"><i>obiter
dicta</i></span>.<a id='r484'></a><a href='#f484' class='c019'><sup>[484]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Another poet of the time, Cowley, ought to have given us
criticism of real importance. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Cowley.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He had the paramount, if not
exclusive, literary interests which are necessary to
a great critic; he had the knowledge; and he
was perhaps the first man in England to possess the best
kind of critical style—lighter than Daniel’s, and less pregnant,
involved, and scholastic than Jonson’s—the style of well-bred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>conversational argument.<a id='r485'></a><a href='#f485' class='c019'><sup>[485]</sup></a> But he was a little bitten with the
scientific as opposed to the literary mania, and, in his own
person, he was perhaps too much of a Janus as regards
literary tastes to be able to give—or indeed to take—a clear
and single view. There were, as in Lope, two poets in Cowley,
and each of these was wont to get in the way of the other.
The one was a “metaphysical” of the high flight, who at
least would, if he could, have been as intensely fantastic as
Donne, and as gracefully fantastic as Suckling. The other
was a classical, “sensible,” couplet-poet, who was working
out Ben Jonson’s theories with even less admixture of
Romanticism than that which tinged Ben Jonson’s practice.
The entanglement of these was sufficiently detrimental to his
poetry; but it would have been absolutely fatal to his criticism,
which must either have perpetually contradicted itself
or else have wandered in a maze, perplexing as perplexed.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is with Davenant’s Preface to <cite>Gondibert</cite>, in the form of
a Letter to Hobbes, and with Hobbes’s answer to it,<a id='r486'></a><a href='#f486' class='c019'><sup>[486]</sup></a> that
England strikes once more into the main path of
European critical development. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Prefatory matter of</i> Gondibert.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> And it is of capital
importance that, both the writers being exiled
royalists, these documents were written at Paris
in the year 1650. There was much interest there in English
affairs, while, as we have seen, the habit of literary discussion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>had, for more than a generation, become ingrained in Frenchmen.
When Davenant set himself to write <cite>Gondibert</cite>, he was
doing exactly what Chapelain and Desmarets and the rest were
doing; and when he and his greater friend exchanged their
epistles, they were doing exactly what all the French literary
world had been doing, not merely, as is commonly thought,
from the time of the <cite>Cid</cite> dispute, but from one much earlier.
Taking all things together, it was natural that the subject
should be the <cite>Heroic Poem</cite>, which had been a favourite of
Italian and French critics for some seventy years and more,
but had been little touched in England, though the conclusion
of Ben’s <cite>Discoveries</cite> shapes a course for it. Hints have been
given before in this History that in the opinion of its writer the
“Heroic Poem” had much in common with that entity which was
long without a literary name, but which an admirable humourist
has now enabled us to describe scientifically as a Boojum<a id='r487'></a><a href='#f487' class='c019'><sup>[487]</sup></a>—that
is to say, it was not only something undiscoverable, but
something which had a malign and, indeed, destructive influence
on those who thought they had discovered it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The “Heroic Poem” was to be neither pure Romance nor
pure Epic, but a sort of medley between the two. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The “Heroic Poem.”</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Or, rather, it
was to be a thing of shreds and patches, strictly epic
(or at least Virgilian-epical) in theory and rules, but
borrowing from Romance whatever it could, as our Elizabethans
would say, “convey cleanly” enough in the way of additional
attractions. The shreds and patches, too, were not purely
poetical: they were not taken simply from Homer and Virgil,
nor even from Horace, Virgil, Lucan, Statius, and the rest down
to that Musæus whom Scaliger thought so superior to the Chian.
A great deal of ancient critical dictum was brought in, and as
Aristotle and Horace had said less about Epic than about
Drama, they were to be supplemented from others, especially
by that treacherous and somewhat obscure passage of Petronius
which has been commented on in its place. In fact the whole
of this Heroic-Poem matter is a sort of satire on criticism by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>Kinds, in its attempt—and failure—to discover a kind. If the
founders of the novel (who, indeed, in some notable cases were
by no means free from the obsession) had persisted in constructing
it on the lines of the Heroic Poem, it would indeed have
been all up with Fiction. To read Tasso (who, as we might
expect, is not the least reasonable) and others, from Ronsard
and Du Bellay down to Desmarets and Le Bossu (both of whom,
let it be remembered, wrote some time after Davenant)—to find
even Dryden a Martha of “machinery,” and comforting himself
with a bright new idea of getting the <span lang="la"><i>deorum ministeria</i></span> out of
the limited intelligences of angels, so that you might not know
at once which side was going to win, as you do in the ordinary
Christian Epic<a id='r488'></a><a href='#f488' class='c019'><sup>[488]</sup></a>—is curious. Nay, it is more—humorous, with
that touch of “the pity of it” which humour nearly always has.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ingenious knight, in explaining his performance and its
principles to his friend the philosopher, takes a very high tone.
Homer, Virgil, Lucan, and Statius are passed successively
in review, and receive each his appropriate compliment,
put with dignified reserves, especially in the two latter
cases. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Davenant’s</i> Examen.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Only two moderns are admitted—Tasso of the Italians—“for
I will yield to their opinion who permit not Ariosto—no,
not Du Bartas—in this eminent rank of the heroicks, rather
than to make way by their admission for Dante, Marino, and
others”<a id='r489'></a><a href='#f489' class='c019'><sup>[489]</sup></a>—and Spenser of our own men. But Tasso is roundly
taken to task for his fairy-tale element, Spenser for his allegory
and his archaism. And the faults of all from Homer downwards
are charged against “the natural humour of imitation.”<a id='r490'></a><a href='#f490' class='c019'><sup>[490]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>After a by no means despicable, but somewhat rhapsodical,
digression on this—it is to be observed that Davenant uses
“Imitation” in the frank modern sense—and an apology for it
as “the dangerous fit of a hot writer,” he gives reasons, partly
no doubt drawn from Italian and French sources, why he has
made his subject (1) Christian, (2) antique but not historical,
(3) foreign, (4) courtly and martial, (5) displaying the distempers
of love and ambition. Then he expounds in turn his
arrangement of five books (to correspond to acts), with cantos
to answer to scenes,<a id='r491'></a><a href='#f491' class='c019'><sup>[491]</sup></a> his arguments, his quatrain-stanza. He
asserts that “the substance is wit,” and discusses that matter at
some length, and with a noteworthy hit at conceits, which reminds
us that Davenant was <span lang="fr"><i>à cheval</i></span> between the First and
the Second Caroline period. He indulges in not unpardonable
loquacity about his poetic aspirations, with a fresh
glance at the great poets of old, and brings in thereby, with
some ingenuity but at too great length as a finale, the old
prefatory matter of the <cite>Arts Poetic</cite> about the importance and
dignity of poetry in the world, concluding exactly where most
begin, with Plato and that “divine anger” of his which some
have turned to the “unjust scandal of Poesie.” And so a
pleasant echo of Sir Philip blends agreeably with the more
prosaic tone, and time, and temper of Sir William.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hobbes, as we should expect, is much briefer; and those
bronze sentences of his (though he had not at this time quite
brought them to their full ring and perfect circumscription)
give no uncertain sound. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Hobbes’s Answer.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He is not, he
says, a poet (which is true), and when he assigns to <cite>Gondibert</cite>
“various experience, ready memory, clear judgment, swift and
well-governed fancy,” it is obvious enough that all these might
be there and yet poetry be absent. He divides the kinds of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>poetry “swiftly” enough, and ranges himself with his customary
decision against those who “take for poesy whatsoever is writ
in verse,” cutting out not merely didactic poetry, but sonnets,
epigrams, and eclogues, and laying it down that “the subject of
a poem is the manners of men.” “They that give entrance to
fictions writ in prose err not so much,” but they err. And
accordingly he begins the discussion of verse. He does not
quarrel with Davenant, as Vida would have done, for deliberately
eschewing Invocation; and rapidly comments on the plot,
characters, description, &#38;c., of the poem. On the head of diction
he would not be Hobbes if he could or did spare a sneer at words
of no sense, words “contunded by the schools,” and so forth.
And since he <em>is</em> Hobbes, there is piquancy in finding him at
one with Walton in the objection to “strong lines.” He is
rather striking on a subject which has been much dwelt on of
late, the blunting of poetic phrase by use. And when he says
that he “never yet saw poem that had so much shape of art,
health of morality, and vigour of beauty and expression” as
<cite>Gondibert</cite>—when, in the odd timorousness he had caught from
Bacon, he adds, that it is only the perishableness of the modern
tongues which will prevent it from lasting as long as the <cite>Æneid</cite>
or the <cite>Iliad</cite>—let us remember that, though criticism is one
thing and compliment another, they sometimes live in a rather
illicit <span lang="la"><i>contubernium</i></span>. At any rate, there <em>is</em> criticism, and real
criticism, in the two pieces; and they are about the first substantial
documents of it in English of which as much can be
said for many years.<a id='r492'></a><a href='#f492' class='c019'><sup>[492]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Thus, although two of these four were of the greatest of our
writers, the third an interesting failure of greatness, and the
fourth far from contemptible, they were in all cases prevented,
by this or that disqualification, from doing much in criticism.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dryden, on the contrary, started with every advantage, except
those of a body of English criticism behind him,
and of a thorough knowledge of the whole of English
literature. <span class='sni side4'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Dryden.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He was a poet nearly, if not quite, of the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>class: and though his poetry had a strong Romantic spirit in
virtue of its perennial quality, it took the form and pressure of
the time so thoroughly and so kindly that there was no internal
conflict. Further, he had what by no means all poets of the
first class have had, a strong, clear, common-sense judgment, and
a very remarkable faculty of arguing the point. And, finally,
if he had few predecessors in English, and perhaps did not know
much of those few except of Jonson, he was fairly, if not exactly
as a scholar, acquainted with the ancients, and he had profited,
and was to profit, by the best doctrine of the moderns.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>His advantages.</i></div>
<p class='c000'>Moreover, from a certain not unimportant point of view, he
occupies a position which is only shared in the history of
criticism by Dante and (in some estimations, though
not in all) by Goethe,—the position of the greatest
man of letters in his own country, if not also in Europe, who is
at the same time the greatest critic, and who is favoured by
Fortune with a concentration of advantages as to time and
circumstance. His critical excellence has indeed never been
wholly overlooked, and, except by the unjuster partisanship of
the early Romantic movement in England, generally admitted
with cheerfulness.<a id='r493'></a><a href='#f493' class='c019'><sup>[493]</sup></a> The want, however, of that synoptic study
of the subject, which it is the humble purpose of this book to
facilitate, has too often prevented his full pre-eminence from
being recognised. It may even be said that it is in criticism
that Dryden best shows that original faculty which has often
been denied him elsewhere. He borrows, indeed, as freely as
everywhere: he copies, with a half ludicrous deference, the stock
opinions of the critics and the criticasters in vogue; he gives us
pages on pages of their pedantic trivialities instead of his own
shrewd and racy judgments. But, despite of all this, there is in
him (and with good luck we may perhaps not fail to disengage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>it) a vein and style in “judging of Authours” which goes
straight back to Longinus, if it is not even independent of that
great ancestry.<a id='r494'></a><a href='#f494' class='c019'><sup>[494]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>This vein is perceptible<a id='r495'></a><a href='#f495' class='c019'><sup>[495]</sup></a> even in the slight critical essays
which precede the <cite>Essay of Dramatic Poesy</cite>, though of course it
is much more evident in the <cite>Essay</cite> itself. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Early Prefaces.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In the
preface to the <cite>Rival Ladies</cite> (written, not indeed when
Dryden was a very young man, but when, except for <cite>Juvenilia</cite>,
he had produced extremely little) we find his critical path clearly
traced, and still more in the three years later Preface to <cite>Annus
Mirabilis</cite>. The principles of this path-making are as follows:
Dryden takes—without perhaps a very laborious study of them,
but, as has been said already, with an almost touching docility
in appearance—the current theories and verdicts of the French,
Italian (and Spanish?) critics whom we should by this time
have sufficiently surveyed. He does not—he never did to the
date of the glorious Preface to the <cite>Fables</cite> itself—dispute the
general doctrines of the sages from Aristotle downwards. But
(and this is where the Longinian resemblance comes in) he never
can help considering the individual works of literature almost
without regard to these principles, and simply on the broad, the
sound, the unshakable ground of the impression they make on
him. Secondly (and this is where the resemblance to Dante
comes in), he is perfectly well aware that questions of diction,
metre, and the like are not mere catchpenny or claptrap afterthoughts,
as ancient criticism was too apt to think them, but at
the root of the pleasure which literature gives. Thirdly (and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>this is where, though Aristotle did not deny the fact, the whole
criticism of antiquity, except that of Longinus, and most of that
of modern times, swerves timorously from the truth), he knows
that this delight, this transport, counts first as a criterion.
Literature in general, poetry in particular, should, of course,
instruct: but it <em>must</em> delight.<a id='r496'></a><a href='#f496' class='c019'><sup>[496]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The “blundering, half-witted people,” as in one of his rare
bursts of not absolutely cool contempt<a id='r497'></a><a href='#f497' class='c019'><sup>[497]</sup></a> he calls his own critics,
who charged him with plagiarising from foreign authors, entirely
missed these differences, which distinguish him from every
foreign critic of his day, and of most days for long afterwards.
He may quote—partly out of that genuine humility and
generosity combined which make his literary character so
agreeable; partly from an innocent parade of learning. But
he never pays for what he borrows the slavish rent, or royalty,
of surrendering his actual and private judgment.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Preface to the <cite>Rival Ladies</cite> the poet-critic takes (as
indeed he afterwards himself fully acknowledged) a wrong line—the
defence of what he calls “verse” (that is to say, rhymed
heroic couplets, not blank verse) for play-writing. This was his
mistress of the time; he rejoiced in her caresses, he wore her
colours, he fought for her beauty—the enjoyment authorising
the argument. But as he has nothing to say that has not been
better said in the <cite>Essay</cite>, we may postpone the consideration of
this. There is one of the slips of fact which can be readily
excused to (and by) all but bad critics,—and which bad critics
are chiefly bound to avoid, because accuracy of fact is their only
title to existence—in his mention of “Queen” <cite>Gorboduc</cite> and his
addition that the dialogue in that play is rhymed; there is an
interesting sigh for an Academy (Dryden, let it be remembered,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>was one of the earliest members of the Royal Society); and there
is the well-known and very amiable, though rather dangerous,
delusion that the excellence and dignity of rhyme were never
known till Mr Waller taught it, and that John Denham’s
<cite>Cooper’s Hill</cite> not only is, but ever will be, the exact standard of
good writing. But he knows Sidney and he knows Scaliger,
and he knows already that Shakespeare “had a larger soul of
poesy than any of our nation.” And a man who knows these
three things in 1664 will go far.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Preface to <cite>Annus Mirabilis</cite><a id='r498'></a><a href='#f498' class='c019'><sup>[498]</sup></a> is again submissive in
form, independent in spirit. Dryden obediently accepts the
prescription for epic or “Heroic” poetry, and though he makes
another slip of fact (or at least of term) by saying that
Chapman’s <cite>Homer</cite> is written in “Alexandrines or verses of
six feet” instead of (as far as the <cite>Iliad</cite> is concerned) in the
fourteener, he is beautifully scholastic on the differences
between Virgil and Ovid, the Heroic and the Burlesque, “Wit
Writing” and “Wit Written.” But he does it with unconquerable
originality, the utterance of his own impression, his
own judgment, breaking through all this school-stuff at every
moment; and also with a valuable (though still inadequate)
account of “the Poet’s imagination.”<a id='r499'></a><a href='#f499' class='c019'><sup>[499]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Yet another point of interest is the avowed intention (carried
out in the poem, to the disgust or at least distaste of Dr
Johnson) of using technical terms. This, one of the neoclassic
devices for attaining propriety, was, as we have seen,
excogitated in Italy, and warmly championed by the Pléiade;
but it had been by this time mostly abandoned, as it was
later by Dryden himself.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The</i> Essay of Dramatic Poesy.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>The <cite>Essay of Dramatic Poesy</cite> is much better known than
it was only a couple of decades ago,<a id='r500'></a><a href='#f500' class='c019'><sup>[500]</sup></a> and it is perhaps superfluous
to say that it is a dialogue in form, and that
the interlocutors are Dryden himself (Neander), his
brother-in-law Sir Robert Howard (Crites), Sir
Charles Sedley (Lisideius), and Lord Buckhurst (Eugenius).
The two last, though at the time the wildest of scapegraces,
were men of distinct poetic gift and varied literary faculty.
And Howard, though no great poet, and possessing something
of the prig, the coxcomb, and the pedant in his composition,
was a man of some ability, of real learning of a kind, and
of very distinct devotion to literature.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <cite>Essay</cite> was first published in 1668, but had been written,
according to Dryden’s statement in his Preface to Lord Buckhurst,
“in the country” (at his father-in-law Lord
Berkshire’s seat of Charlton near Malmesbury),
when the author was driven out of London by the Great
Plague three years before. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Its setting and overture.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He had, he says, altered some
of his opinions; but it did not much matter in an Essay
“where all I have said is problematical.” The “Address to
the Reader” promises a second part dealing with Epic and
Lyric, which never appeared, and of which only the Epic part
is represented by later works. This is a pity, for while we
have treatises on Drama and Epic <span lang="la"><i>ad nauseam</i></span>, their elder
and lovelier sister has been, “poor girl! neglected.” It begins
with a picturesque setting, which represents the four interlocutors
as having taken boat and shot the bridge, attracted by
the reverberation of the great battle with the Dutch in the
early part of June 1665, when Admiral Opdam’s flag-ship was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>blown up. Eugenius augurs victory from the gradual dying
away of the noise; and Crites observes (in character) that
he should like this victory better if he did not know how
many bad verses he should have to read on it. Lisideius adds
that he knows some poets who have got <i>epinikia</i> and funeral
elegies all ready for either event, and the dialogue proceeds
for some time in the same way of literary banter, especial
set being made at two poets (one of whom is certainly Wild,
while the other <em>may</em> be Flecknoe) with incidental sneers at
Wither(s) and Cleveland. At last Crites brings it to something
like the quarrel of Ancient <i>v.</i> Modern. Eugenius picks
up the glove, but consents, at Crites’ suggestion, to limit the
discussion to dramatic poetry,<a id='r501'></a><a href='#f501' class='c019'><sup>[501]</sup></a> and so the “dependence” is
settled.</p>

<p class='c000'>Eugenius thinks that though modern plays are better than
Greek or Roman, yet those of “the last age” (1600-1660) are
better than “ours.” <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Crites for the Ancients.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> As for epic and lyric, the last
age must yield.  And all the quartette agree that
“the sweetness of English verse was never understanded or
practised” by our fathers, and that some writers yet living
first taught us to mould our thoughts into easy and significant
words, to retrench the superfluities of expression, and to make
our rhyme so properly a part of the verse that it should never
mislead the sense. Lisideius having (with the consent of the
company, subject to a slight scholastic objection from Crites)
defined or described a play as “A just and lively image of
human nature, representing its passions and humours, and the
changes of fortune to which it is subject, for the delight and
instruction of mankind,” Crites takes up his brief for the
ancients. His speech is a set one, extolling the classical conception
of drama, and especially the modern-classical Unities,</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>but rather a panegyric than an argument, and particularly weak
in this—that it takes no critical account of the modern drama
at all. Except Ben Jonson, “the greatest man of the last age,”
not a single modern dramatic writer of any country is so much
as named.</p>

<p class='c000'>Eugenius, though his discourse is livelier, falls into something
the same fault, or at least the counterpart of it. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Eugenius for the “last age.”</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He
rallies the ancients unmercifully, and has very good
game of the stock plots and characters in Terence;
but his commendation of the moderns has a disappointing
generality, and he lays himself rather open to the
good-humoured but forcible interruption of Crites that he and
Eugenius are never likely to come to an agreement, because
the one regards change as in itself an improvement, and the
other does not.</p>

<p class='c000'>Still, Lisideius gives a new turn to the discussion by asking
Eugenius why he puts English plays above those of other
nations, and whether we ought not to submit our
stage to the exactness of our next neighbours.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Lisideius for the French.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Eugenius in reply commits the further and especial defence of
the English to Neander, and Lisideius begins his part as
eulogist of the French. For some forty years, he says, we have
not had leisure to be good poets. The French have: and, by
Richelieu’s patronage and Corneille’s example, have raised their
theatre till it now surpasses ours, and the rest of Europe.
Who have kept the Unities so well? Who have avoided “that
absurd thing,” the English tragi-comedy, so completely? In
tragedy they take well-known stories, and only manageable
parts of them, while Shakespeare crams the business of thirty
or forty years into two hours and a half. They make only one
person prominent, they do as much as possible behind the
scenes, keep dying off the stage altogether, and never end their
plays with a conversion, or simple change of will. Nobody,
with them, appears on the stage, unless he has some business
there: and as for the beauty of their rhyme, why, that is
“already partly received by us,” and it will, no doubt, when we
write better plays, “exceedingly beautify them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>To him, Neander—that is to say—Dryden himself.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>There is a reminder (though the matter is quite different) of
Daniel, and a comforting augury for English criticism, in the
swift directness with which “the new critic” (as a
Webbe of his own day might have called him)
strikes at the heart of the question. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Dryden for England and Liberty.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The French
are more regular, he grants, and our irregularities are, in some
cases, justly taxed. But, nevertheless, he is of opinion that
neither our faults nor their virtues are sufficient to place them
above us. For Lisideius himself has defined a play as a lively
imitation <em>of nature</em>. And these beauties of the French stage
are beauties, not natural, but thoroughly artificial. Before
Molière, where are the humours of French comedy, save,
perhaps, in <span lang="fr"><i>Le Menteur</i></span> and a few others? Elsewhere they
work in comedy only by the old way of quarrels and reconciliations,
or by the conventions of Spanish intrigue-drama. “On
which lines there is not above one play to be writ: they are
too much alike to please often.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, as to tragi-comedy. What is the harm of this? why
should Lisideius “imagine the soul of man more heavy than his
senses?” The eye can pass, and pass with relief, from an
unpleasant to a pleasant object, in far less time than is required
on the stage. He must have stronger arguments before
he concludes that compassion and mirth destroy each other:
and in the meantime he will hold that tragi-comedy is a more
pleasant way than was known to the ancients, or any moderns
who have eschewed it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next, and closely connected, as to single-plot <i>v.</i> plot +
underplot. Why is the former to be preferred to the latter?
Because it gives a greater advantage to the expression of
passion? Dryden can only say that he thinks “their” verse the
“coldest” he has ever read, and he supports this by a close and
pleasant beating-up-the-quarters of <cite>Cinna</cite> and <cite>Pompey</cite>, “not
so properly to be called plays as long discourses on reason
of state”; of <cite>Polyeucte</cite>, “as solemn as the long stops on an
organ,” of their mighty tirades and <span lang="fr"><i>récits</i></span>. “Whereas in
tragedy it is unnatural for any one either to speak or listen
long, and in comedy quick repartee is the chiefest grace.”
Yet again “they” are praised for making only one person considerable.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>Why? If variety is not mere confusion, is it not
always pleasing?<a id='r502'></a><a href='#f502' class='c019'><sup>[502]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The question of narrative against represented action is
treated with less boldness, and, therefore, with less success:
but he comes to the sound, if not very improving, conclusion
that, if we show too much action, the French show too little.
He has an interesting rebuke, however, here to Ben Jonson, for
reprehending “the incomparable Shakespeare.”<a id='r503'></a><a href='#f503' class='c019'><sup>[503]</sup></a> And he rises
again, and makes a capital point, by citing Corneille’s own
confession of the cramping effect of the Unities, enlarging
whereon himself, he has an admirable exposure of the utterly
unnatural conditions which observance of these Unities brings
about. Then, after some remarks on prosody and the earlier
use of rhyme in English—remarks partly true, partly vitiated
by imperfect knowledge—he undertakes to produce plays as
regular as theirs and with more variety, instancing <cite>The Silent
Woman</cite>. Of this he is proceeding to a regular <span lang="la"><i>examen</i></span> when
Eugenius requests a character of the author: and Neander, after
a little mannerly excuse, not only complies with this request,
but prefixes similar characters of Shakespeare and Fletcher.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first of these is universally, the second and third should
be pretty well known. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Coda <i>on rhymed plays, and conclusion</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It must be sufficient to say here that
nothing like even the worst of the three (that of
Beaumont and Fletcher, which wants the adequacy
and close grip of the other two) had previously been
seen in English, and not many things in any other
language, while to this day, with all faults, the character of
Shakespeare is one of the <span lang="la"><i>apices</i></span> of universal criticism. The
characters are followed by the <span lang="la"><i>examen</i></span>—also admirable and
quite new in English, though with more pattern elsewhere.
And he ends with a short peroration, the keynote of which is,
“I ask no favour from the French.” Lisideius is going to reply;
but Crites interrupting, diverts the discussion to a particular
point already glanced at—the use of rhyme in plays. He (sensibly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>enough) declines to investigate very carefully whether this
was a revival of the old English custom or an imitation of the
French, but attacks its legitimacy with the usual, obvious, and
fairly sound argument that since no man without premeditation
speaks in rhyme, he ought not to do it on the stage, anticipating
the retort, “neither does he speak blank verse” by urging that
this at any rate is “nearest nature” or less <em>un</em>natural. Neander,
taking up the glove for “his <em>new</em>-loved mistress,” practically
admits the weakness of his case by first advancing the very
argument as to blank verse which Crites has disallowed by
anticipation. The rest of his answer is a mixture of true and
not so true, of imperfect knowledge and ingenious argument,
constantly open to reply, but always interesting as a specimen
of critical advocacy. He represents himself as pursuing the
discourse so eagerly that Eugenius had to remind him that “the
boat stood still,” and that they had come to their destination at
Somerset stairs. And with a pleasant final patch of description
the dialogue closes.</p>

<p class='c000'>In reading it we should keep in mind what he says a quarter
of a century later to the same correspondent,<a id='r504'></a><a href='#f504' class='c019'><sup>[504]</sup></a> that he was at this
time seeking his way “in a vast ocean” of criticism
without other help than the pole-star of the ancients
and the rules of the French stage amongst the
moderns. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Conspicuous merits of the piece.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He has given the reading of the pole-star to Crites,
and has pointed out the dangers of mere dead-reckoning by it.
He has put into the mouth of Sedley (with a touch of malice
which that ingenious good-for-nothing must have noticed, and
which it is to his credit that he did not resent) a similar reading
of the bearings of the different French lights, and has
shown how little they assisted the English mariner—indeed,
how some of them actually led to rocks and quicksands, instead
of warning off from them. In the mouth of Buckhurst, and in
his own, he has put the patriotic apology, inclining it in the
former case towards laudation of the past, and in the latter to
defence of the present: and he has allowed divers excursions
from the immediate subject—especially that on “verse,” or
rhymed heroics, as a dramatic medium. One of the chief of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>the many merits of the piece is precisely this, that at the time
Dryden had read less than at a later, and was less tempted to
add quotations or comments. He was following chiefly a very
safe guide—Corneille—and he bettered his guide’s instruction.
It may be said boldly that, up to the date, nothing in the way of
set appreciation—no, not in Longinus himself—had appeared
equal to the three characters of Shakespeare, Jonson, and
Fletcher; while almost greater still is the constant application
of the “leaden rule,” the taking of book, author, kind, <em>as it is</em>,
and judging it accordingly, instead of attempting to force everything
into agreement or disagreement with a prearranged
schedule of rules.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the publication of the <cite>Essay of Dramatic Poesy</cite>, Dryden
(English literature can hardly give too many thanks for it) had
more than thirty well-filled years of life allowed
him; and to the very last, and at the very last,
criticism had its full share of his labours. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Middle Prefaces.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The “Prefaces of
Dryden” never fail to give valuable matter; and we shall have
to notice most, if not all of them, though the notices may be of
varying length. The immediate successor and, in fact, appendix
to the <cite>Essay</cite>, the <cite>Defence</cite> thereof, was only printed in one edition,
the second, of <cite>The Indian Emperor</cite>, and is very far from being
of the best. Sir Robert Howard was, as has been said, a
man conceited and testy, as Shadwell’s nickname for him in
<cite>The Sullen Lovers</cite>, Sir Positive Atall, hints. He seems to
have been nettled by his part of Crites, and replied with
some heat in a Preface to his own play, <cite>The Duke of Lerma</cite>.
Dryden, who never quite learned the wisdom of Bacon’s
<span lang="la"><i>dictum</i></span>, “<span lang="la">Qui replicat multiplicat,</span>” and who at this time
had not yet learnt the easy disdain of his later manner,
riposted (1668) with more sense but with not much more temper.
The piece (which was practically withdrawn later) contained,
besides not too liberal asperities on Sir Robert’s own work, a
further “defence of Rhyme,” not like Daniel’s, where it should
be, but where it should not. It is redeemed by an occasional
admission, in Dryden’s usual and invaluable manner, that he is
quite aware of the other side, and by an unhesitating assertion
of the primacy of Delight among the Objects of Poetry.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>In none of the next three or four of the pieces do we find
him quite at his best. For some few years, indeed, the popularity
of his splendid, if sometimes a little fustianish, heroics,
the profits of his connection with the theatre (which, added to
other sources of revenue, made him almost a rich man in his
way), and his association with the best society, seem to have
slightly intoxicated him. He saw his error, like other wise
men, all in good time, and even the error itself was not more
than human and pardonable.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Preface to <cite>An Evening’s Love</cite> promises, but for the time
postpones, an extension of the criticism of “the last age,”
and intersperses some valuable remarks on the difference
between Comedy and Farce, between Wit and Humour, with
a good deal of egotism and some downright arrogance.<a id='r505'></a><a href='#f505' class='c019'><sup>[505]</sup></a>
The <cite>Essay of Heroic Plays</cite> prefixed to <cite>The Conquest of
Granada</cite> (1672) is as yet unconverted as to rhyme on the
stage; but contains some interesting criticism of Davenant’s
essays in the kind, and a curious defence (recurred to later)
of supernatural “machinery.” The main gist of the Preface,
besides its defence of the extravagances of Almanzor, is an
elaborate adjustment of the Heroic Play to the rules of the
much-talked-of Heroic Poem. But though there is a good
deal of self-sufficiency here, it is as nothing to the drift of the
Epilogue to the second part of the play, and of an elaborate
Prose “Defence” of this Epilogue. Here Dryden takes up the
position that in “the last age,” when men were dull and conversation
low, Shakespeare and Fletcher had not, while Jonson
did not avail himself of, access to that higher society which delighted
to honour him, Dryden. Divers flings at the “solecisms,”
“flaws in sense,” “mean writing,” “lame plots,” “carelessness,”
“luxuriance,” “pedantry” of these poor creatures lead up to a
statement that “<em>Gentlemen</em> will now be entertained with the
foibles <em>of each other</em>.” Never again do we find Dryden writing
like this; and for his having done it at all Rochester’s “Black
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>Will with a cudgel” exacted sufficient, as suitable, atonement
in the Rose Alley ambuscade, even from the lowest point of
view. From a higher, he himself made an ample apology to
Shakespeare in the Prologue to <cite>Aurungzebe</cite>, and practically
never repeated the offence.</p>

<p class='c000'>The curious <cite>State of Innocence</cite> (1677) (a much better thing
than rigid Miltonists admit) is preceded by an equally curious
<cite>Apology of Heroic Poetry</cite>, in which, yet once more, we find the
insufficient sense in which Imagination (here expressly limited
to “Imaging”) was used; while the Preface to <cite>All for Love</cite> (1678)
is a very little ill-tempered towards an anonymous lampooner,
who was, in fact, Rochester. <cite>Troilus and Cressida</cite> (1679) was
ushered by a set preliminary <cite>Discourse on the Grounds of Criticism
in Tragedy</cite>. No piece illustrates more remarkably that
mixed mode of criticism in Dryden, to bring out which is our
chief design. On a canvas, not it must be confessed of much
interest, woven out of critical commonplaces from Aristotle and
Longinus down to Rymer and Le Bossu, he has embroidered a
great number of most valuable observations of his own, chiefly
on Shakespeare and Fletcher, which culminate in a set description
of Fletcher as “a limb of Shakespeare”—a thing happy in
itself and productive of happy imitations since. The Preface to
the translation of Ovid’s <cite>Epistles</cite> (1680) chiefly consists of a
fresh defence of that ingenious writer (for whom Dryden had no
small fancy), and the Dedication to Lord Haughton of <cite>The
Spanish Friar</cite> (1681) is mainly notable for an interesting confession
of Dryden’s changes of opinion about Chapman and Du
Bartas (Sylvester rather), and a sort of apology for his own
dallying with these Delilahs of the theatre in the rants of
Almanzor and Maximin.</p>

<p class='c000'>But that to the <cite>Second Miscellany</cite>, five years later, after a
period chiefly occupied with the great political satires, ranges
with the <cite>Essay</cite>, and not far below the <cite>Fables</cite> Preface, among
Dryden’s critical masterpieces. The thing is not long—less
than twenty pages. But it gives a coherent and defensible, if
also disputable, theory of translation, a singularly acute, and, it
would appear, original contrast of the <i>faire</i> of Ovid and of Claudian,
more detailed studies of Virgil, Lucretius (singularly good),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>Horace, and Theocritus, and the best critical stricture in
English on “Pindaric” verse. After it the note of the
same year on Opera, which ushered <cite>Albion and Albanius</cite>, is of
slight importance.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dedication of the Third Miscellany (specially named
<span lang="la"><cite>Examen Poeticum</cite></span>, as the second had been sub-titled <span lang="la"><cite>Sylvæ</cite></span>)
contains some interesting protests against indiscriminate critical
abuse, the final formulation of a saying sketched before (“the
corruption of a poet is the generation of a critic”), illustrated
from Scaliger in the past and (not obscurely though not <span lang="la"><i>nominatim</i></span>)
from Rymer in the present; and, among other things,
some remarks on prosody which might well have been fuller.</p>

<p class='c000'>Between this and the Fables, besides some lesser things,<a id='r506'></a><a href='#f506' class='c019'><sup>[506]</sup></a>
there appeared two of the longest and most ambitious in
appearance of Dryden’s critical writings, the <i>Essay</i>
[strictly <i>Discourse</i>] <i>on Satire</i> prefixed to the <cite>Juvenal</cite>,
and the <cite>Dedication of the Æneis</cite>, with, between them,
the first writing at any length by a very distinguished
Englishman of letters, on the subject of pictorial art,
in the shape of the <cite>Parallel of Poetry and Painting</cite> prefixed to
the translation of Du Fresnoy <span lang="la"><cite>De Arte Graphica</cite></span>. <span class='sni side12'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Essay on Satire <i>and the</i> Dedication of the Æneis.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> All, being
Dryden’s, are, and could not but be, admirably written and full
of interest. But the <cite>Juvenal</cite> and <cite>Virgil</cite> Prefaces are, in respect
of permanent value, both intrinsically and representively injured
by an excess of critical erudition. The time was perhaps not
yet ripe for an honest and candid address straight to the English
reader.  The translator was bound to recommend himself to
classical scholars by attention to the paraphernalia of what
then regarded itself as scholarship (“other brides, other paraphernalia”
no doubt), and to propitiate wits, and Templars, and
the gentlemen of the Universities, with original or borrowed
discourses on literary history and principle.  Dryden fell in
with the practice, and obliged his readers with large decoctions
of Rigaltius and Casaubon, Dacier and Segrais, which are at
any rate more palatable than the learned originals, but which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>make us feel, rather ruefully, that boiling down such things was
not the work for which the author of <cite>Absalom and Achitophel</cite>
and of <cite>The Essay on Dramatic Poesy</cite> was born.</p>

<p class='c000'>As for the <cite>Parallel</cite>, it is of course interesting as being nearly
our first Essay, and that by a master hand, in a kind of criticism
which has later given excellent results. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Parallel of Poetry and Painting.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But Dryden,
as he most frankly admits, did not know very much
about the matter, and his work resolves itself very
mainly into a discussion of the principles of Imitation
in general, applied in an idealist manner to the two arts in
particular. Again we may say, “Not here, O Apollo!”</p>

<p class='c000'>We have nothing left but the <cite>Preface to the Fables</cite>, the extraordinary
merit of which has been missed by no competent critic
from Johnson to Mr Ker. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Preface to the Fables.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The wonderful ease and
urbanity of it, the artfully varied forms of reply to
the onslaughts of Collier and others, are not more generally
agreeable than are, in a special division, the enthusiastic eulogy
of Chaucer (all the more entertaining because of its lack of
mere pedantic accuracy in places), and the interesting, if again
not always rigidly accurate, scraps of literary history. It winds
up, as the <cite>Essay</cite> had practically begun, a volume of critical
writing which, if not for pure, yet for applied, mixed, and sweetened
criticism, deserves to be put on the shelf—no capacious one—reserved
for the best criticism of the world.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have seen, over and over again, in individual example;
have already partially summed more than once; and shall have
to re-sum with more extensive view later, the character and the
faults of the critical method which had been forming itself for
some hundred and fifty years when Dryden began his critical
work. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Dryden’s general critical position.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It would be absurd to pretend that he was entirely superior
to this “Spirit of the Age”—which was also that of the age
behind him, and (with rare exceptions) of the age to
come for nearly a hundred years. But, although it
may be paradoxical, it is not absurd at all, to
express satisfaction that he was not so entirely
superior. He was enabled by his partial—and, in so far as his
consciousness went, quite sincere—orthodoxy, to obtain an
access to the general hearing in England, and even to influence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>long after his death, important literary authorities, as he never
could have done if he had set up for an iconoclast. Furthermore,
it was not yet time to break these idols. Apollo winked
at the neo-classical ignorance and heresy because it was useful.
We are so apt—so generously and excusably apt—to look at the
Miltons without considering the Clevelands, that we forget how
absolutely ungoverned, and in some cases how near to puerility,
the latest Elizabethan school was. We forget the slough of
shambling verse in which true poets, men like Suckling in
drama, men like Lovelace in lyric, complacently wallowed.
The strait waistcoat was almost necessary, even after the fine
madness, much more after the madness not so fine, of mid-seventeenth-century
verse, and, in a less degree, prose. And so,
when we find Dryden belittling the rhymes of <cite>Comus</cite> and
<cite>Lycidas</cite>,<a id='r507'></a><a href='#f507' class='c019'><sup>[507]</sup></a> shaking his head over Shakespeare’s carelessness, unable
with Chapman, as Ben had been with Marlowe, to see the
fire for the smoke, we need not in the least excite ourselves, any
more than when we find him dallying with the Dowsabels of
Renaissance school-criticism. In the first place, the thing had
to be done; and in the second place, his manner of doing it
went very far to supply antidote to all the bane, as well as to
administer the “corsives,” as they said then, in the mildest
and most innocuous way possible.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>His special critical method.</i></div>

<p class='c000'>Dryden’s moly, an herb so powerful that—herein excelling
its original—it not only prevented men like Addison from becoming
beasts like Rymer, but had the virtue of turning beasts
into men,—of replacing the neo-classic jargon by the pure language
of criticism,—was that plan of actual comparison and
examination of actual literature which is not merely the <span lang="la"><i>via
prima</i></span> but the <span lang="la"><i>via sola</i></span> of safety for the critic. By his time
there was assembled a really magnificent body of modern
letters, in addition to classical and mediæval. But
nobody in the late seventeenth century, except
Dryden, really utilised it.  Italy and Spain were
sinking into premature senility.  The French<a id='r508'></a><a href='#f508' class='c019'><sup>[508]</sup></a> despised or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>ignored all modern literatures but their own, and despised and
ignored almost equally their own rich and splendid mediæval
stores.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dryden’s freedom from this worst and most hopeless vice is
all the more interesting because, from some of his utterances, we
might have expected him not to be free from it.<a id='r509'></a><a href='#f509' class='c019'><sup>[509]</sup></a> That theory
of his as to Mr Waller; that disastrous idea that Shakespeare
and Fletcher were low people who had not the felicity to
associate with gentlemen,—might seem likely to produce the
most fatal results. But not so. He accepts Chaucer at once,
rejoices in him, extols him, just as if Chaucer had taken lessons
from Mr Waller, and had been familiar with my Lord Dorset.
Back his own side as he may in the duel of the theatres, he
speaks of the great lights of the last age in such a fashion
that no one has outgone him since. He cannot really take an
author in hand, be he Greek or Latin, Italian or French or English,
without his superiority to rules and systems and classifications
appearing at once, however he may, to please fashion and
fools, drag these in as an afterthought, or rather (for Dryden
never “drags” in anything save the indecency in his comedies)
draw them into the conversation with his usual adroitness.
And he is constantly taking authors in hand in this way,—we
are as certain that this, and not twaddling about unities and
machines, was what he liked doing, as we are that he wrote
comedies for money, and satires and criticism itself for love.
Now this,—the critical reading without theory, or with theory
postponed, of masses of different literatures, and the formation
and expression of genuine judgment as to what the critic liked
and disliked in them, not what he thought he ought to like and
dislike,—this was what was wanted, and what nobody had yet
done. Dryden did it—did it with such mastery of expression
as would almost have commended a Rymer, but with such
genuine critical power and sympathy as would almost have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>carried off the absence of merits of expression altogether. He
established (let us hope for all time) the English fashion of
criticising, as Shakespeare did the English fashion of dramatising,—the
fashion of aiming at delight, at truth, at justice, at
nature, at poetry, and letting the rules take care of themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>Perhaps in no single instance of critical authorship and
authority does the great method of comparison assist us so
well as in the case of Dryden and Boileau. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Dryden and Boileau.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> This
comparison is absolutely fair. The two were almost
exact contemporaries; they represented—so far at least as their
expressed and, in both cases, no doubt conscientious, literary
creed went—the same sect. <span lang="fr"><cite>Enfin Malherbe vint</cite></span> is an exact
parallel, whether as a wonderful discovery or a partly mischievous
delusion, to the exploits on our numbers by Mr Waller.
Both were extremely powerful satirists. Both, though not comparable
in intrinsic merit, were among the chief men of letters
of their respective countries. Both had a real, and not merely
a professional or affected, devotion to literature. Both applied,
with whatever difference of exclusiveness and <span lang="la"><i>animus</i></span>, a peculiar
literary discipline, new to the country of each. And in the case
of both—it has been decided by a consensus of the best judges,
with all the facts before them up to the present time—there was
an insufficient looking before and after, a pretension to limit
literature to certain special developments.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have seen what, in carrying out the scheme which was
in effect the scheme of both, were the defects of Boileau. Let
us see what, in contra-position to them, are the merits of
Dryden.</p>

<p class='c000'>That, though he makes mistakes enough in literary history,
these mistakes are slight in comparison with Boileau’s, matters
not very much; that, though his satiric touch was more withering
even than the Frenchman’s, he has no love of lashing merely
for the sport, and never indulges in insolent flings at harmless
dulness, suffering poverty, or irregular genius; that, though
quite prone enough to flatter, he declined to bow the knee
to William of Orange, while Boileau persistently grovelled at
the feet of William’s enemy,—these things matter even less to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>us. The fact, the critical fact, remains that the faults of his
time and his theory did the least harm to Dryden of all men
whom we know, while they did the most to Boileau. And the
reason of the fact is more valuable than the fact itself. Boileau,
as we have seen, has not left us a single impartial and appreciative
criticism of a single author, ancient or modern. Dryden
simply cannot find himself in presence of a man of real genius,
whether he belongs to his own school or another, without
having his critical lips at once touched by Apollo and Pallas.
He was sadly ignorant about Chaucer,—a board-school child
might take him to task; but he has written about Chaucer with
far more real light and sympathy than some at least of the
authors of the books from which the board-school child derives
its knowledge have shown. His theory about Shakespeare,
Fletcher, and Jonson was defective; but he has left us criticisms
of all three than which we have, and are likely to have, no
better. About the ancients he borrows from both ancients and
moderns; but it is remarkable that while Boileau’s borrowings
are his best, Dryden’s are infinitely his worst part. So the
consequence is that while Boileau is merely a <span lang="fr"><i>point de repère</i></span>, a
historical document which men simply strive to bring to some
relation with the present and the future, Dryden is and will
remain at once a source and a model for ever. And he is these
because he had the wisdom to ask himself the question, “Do I
think this good or bad?” and the wit to answer it, instead of
asking and answering the other, “Is it good or bad according
to this or that scheme and schedule?”</p>

<p class='c000'>We have, in short, in Dryden the first very considerable
example in England, if not anywhere, of the critic who, while
possessing fairly wide knowledge of literature, attributes no
arbitrary or conventional eminence to certain parts of it, but at
least endeavours to consider it as a whole; of the critic who is
never afraid to say “Why?”; of the critic who asks, not whether
he ought to like such and such a thing, but whether he does
like it, and why he likes it, and whether there is any real reason
why he should not like it; of the critic, finally, who tries, without
prepossession or convention, to get a general grasp of the
book or author, and then to set forth that grasp in luminous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>language, and with a fair display of supporting analysis and
argument. Dryden, of course, is far—very far—from being a
faultless monster of criticism. The application of his own process
to his own theory will discover in it many mistakes, independent
of the imperfect knowledge which has been already
admitted, of the inconsistencies which are more of a virtue than
of a defect, and of the concessions to tradition and fashion which
are almost wholly unfortunate. Nay, more, it may be granted
that Dryden did not escape the dangers of the process itself, the
dangers of vagueness, of desultoriness, of dilettantism. But he
has the root of the matter in him. He knows that art exists to
give pleasure, and when he says “I am pleased with this,” he
insists on strong reasons being given to show that he ought not
to be so. He admits also—nay, insists on—nature, variety, individuality.
He will “connoisseur no man out of his senses,”<a id='r510'></a><a href='#f510' class='c019'><sup>[510]</sup></a>
and refuses to be so connoisseured by any, while he will give
good reasons for his own and others’ pleasure. These are the
marks of the true and catholic criticism; and Dryden has
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Let us pass from him directly to one who has them not.
There are few English critics who require to be dealt with at
once more carefully and more faithfully than does
Thomas Rymer. <span class='sni side4'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Rymer.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He has become a name, and to
become a name is to be at least on the way to becoming a
legend, if not a myth. Moreover, as his legend is (for good
reasons) far from a favourable one, it has been made more
legendary by those generous or wayward revolts against it
which are not uncommon. It has even been held proper, for
some time, to shake the head of deprecation over Macaulay’s
“the worst critic that ever lived.” Moreover, Rymer is by no
means very accessible—in his critical works, of course, for we
speak not here of the <span lang="la"><i>Fœdera</i></span>. Whether these were originally
published in very small numbers; whether the common-sense
of mankind rose against them and subjected them in unusual
proportions to the “martyrdom of pies”; or whether (by one of
Time’s humorous revenges) the copies have been absorbed into
special collections relating to that <span lang="la"><i>altissimo poeta</i></span> whom Rymer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>blasphemed, I cannot say. But it is certain that very good
libraries often possess either none or only a part of them, and
that on the rare occasions on which they appear in catalogues
they are priced at about as many pounds as they are intrinsically
worth farthings. I think I have seen notices of Rymer
which evidently confused <cite>The Tragedies of the Last Age</cite> (1678)
with <cite>A Short View of Tragedy</cite> (1693).<a id='r511'></a><a href='#f511' class='c019'><sup>[511]</sup></a> Besides these two,
Rymer, independently of smaller things and reissues, had produced,
earlier than the earlier, in 1674, a preface to his own
translation of Rapin’s <cite>Reflections</cite>, which completes the trinity
of his important criticism. No one of the three is long; in fact,
<cite>The Tragedies of the Last Age</cite> is a very tiny book, which, short
as it is, seems to have exhausted the author before he could
carry out half his scheme.</p>

<p class='c000'>A careful and comparative reading of all three has given me
a settled, and I think a just, conception of Rymer as of a man
of remarkable learning for his age and country, but intensely
stupid to begin with, and Puck-led by the <span lang="fr"><i>Zeitgeist</i></span> into a
charcoal-burner’s faith in “the rules.” <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Preface to Rapin.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In the <cite>Preface</cite><a id='r512'></a><a href='#f512' class='c019'><sup>[512]</sup></a> he is
less crabbed than in the two booklets; and, though he already
uses the would-be humorous hail-fellow-well-met
colloquialism characteristic of the lower Restoration
style, and employed even by such a man of letters as L’Estrange
and such scholars as Collier and Bentley, he does not push it to
the same lengths of clumsy ass-play as later. He thinks that
“poets would grow negligent if Critics had not a strict eye
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>on their miscarriages,” yet he admits that this eye sometimes
squints, and compares some critics to “Wasps that rather annoy
the Bees than terrify the drones.” Then he skims the past,
noticing Castelvetro, Malherbe, and others, but thinks that till
lately “England was as free from Critics as from Wolves,” Ben
Jonson having all the critical learning to himself. After praise
of Aristotle and a short notice of his actual author, he then proceeds
to consider the history of English poetry independently.
As for Chaucer, “our language was not then capable of any heroic
character,” nor indeed was the most polite wit of Europe “sufficient
for a great design.” Spenser had “a large spirit, a sharp
judgment, and a genius for Heroic poetry perhaps above any
that ever wrote since Virgil,” but “wanted a true idea,” and
was misled by Ariosto. “They who can love Ariosto will be
ravished with Spenser, but men of juster thoughts,” &#38;c. His
stanza is “nowise proper for our language.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Davenant and Cowley are criticised with politeness, but not
very favourably; the faults of both, as well as their designs,
were what Rymer was capable of understanding, and neither
provokes him to any rudeness on the one hand or stupidity on
the other, though there is an occasional ripple betraying an
undercurrent of asperity. Then, after some more general remarks,
he takes the accepted test of the Description of Night,
and applies it with mixed commendation to Apollonius Rhodius,
with rather independent criticism to Virgil, slightingly to Ariosto,
and rather cavillingly to Tasso, with a good deal of censure
to Marino, and with more to Chapelain, with about as much to
Père Le Moyne, and then with very considerable praise to that
passage of Dryden’s in the <cite>Conquest of Mexico</cite> to which Wordsworth
was afterwards nearly as unjust as Rymer himself to far
greater things.<a id='r513'></a><a href='#f513' class='c019'><sup>[513]</sup></a> And with this rather patronising “Well done
our side!” he stops.</p>

<p class='c000'>Had Rymer done nothing more than this in criticism it would
indeed be absurd to call him our best critic, but it would be
still more absurd to call him our worst. There is fair knowledge,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>there is fair common-sense judgment; the remarks on
Chaucer are merely what might be expected, and on Spenser
rather better than might be expected; the detailed censure is
correct enough; and though there cannot be said to be any
great appreciation of poetry, there is interest in it. Above all,
if the piece stood alone, we should hardly think of detecting in
it even a murmur of the pedantic snarl which is the one unpardonable
sin of a critic.</p>

<p class='c000'>In <cite>The Tragedies of the Last Age</cite> Rymer <span lang="fr"><i>ruit in pejus</i></span>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Tragedies of the Last Age.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He
had in the interval received some praise, which is always bad
for an ill-conditioned man and dangerous for a
stupid one; he had conceived the idea of being
bee as well as wasp; and he undertook to show
Beaumont and Fletcher, Shakespeare and Jonson, their errors,
though as matter of fact he lost his wind in belabouring the
twins, and had to leave the others till he had taken fifteen
years’ breath. He shows himself at once in a mood of facetious
truculence and self-importance. <em>He</em> is not going to emulate
“the <cite>Remarks</cite> and eternal triflings of French Grammaticasters.”
But he is going to set the “quibble-catching” of his countrymen
right, and to put an end to “the Stage-quacks and Empirics
in poetry” who despise the rules. “Fancy leaps and
frisks, and away she’s gone; while Reason rattles the chain, and
follows after,” in which flight Rymer, as often, does not seem to
perceive that he is not exactly giving Reason and himself
the <span lang="fr"><i>beau rôle</i></span>. Then he sets to work on three plays of
Beaumont and Fletcher. In <cite>Rollo</cite> there is nothing to move
pity and terror, nothing to delight, nothing to instruct.<a id='r514'></a><a href='#f514' class='c019'><sup>[514]</sup></a> In <cite>A
King and No King</cite> Panthea actually suggests kissing!<a id='r515'></a><a href='#f515' class='c019'><sup>[515]</sup></a> Arbaces
is so bad that he really made Rymer think of Cassius—a withering
observation which foretells what the critic was going to
say about Shakespeare, though on this occasion he was too exhausted
to say it.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>He said it fifteen years later with no uncertain voice. The
one redeeming feature of the <cite>Short View</cite> is its remarkable, if
not quite impeccable, learning. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Short View of Tragedy.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Rymer really knows
something about “Provencial” poetry, though he
confuses it (and thereby made Dryden confuse it)
with old French, and actually regards Philippe Mouskès—not
even a Frenchman but a Fleming—as a “troubadour.” Still, his
knowledge is to be praised, and his ignorance forgiven. Less
forgivable, but still not fatal, are the singular want of method
with which he flings the result of his learning, pell-mell with
his own remarks, on the reader, and (in a yet further degree of
culpability) the vulgar jeering of his style. But all this might
still pass. His mistakes are much less, and his knowledge
much greater, than those of any critic of his age. Others have
lacked method; and Bentley was quite, Collier very nearly, as
coarsely rude. On some general points, such as the utility of
the chorus in keeping playwrights to the rules, he is not unintelligent.
He is a great admirer of dumb-show, and thinks
that many of the tragical scenes, not merely in Shakespeare, but
in Jonson, would go better without words.</p>

<p class='c000'>More than half the little book<a id='r516'></a><a href='#f516' class='c019'><sup>[516]</sup></a> is occupied with a display of
his learning—first in some general remarks on the drama, and
then in a history of it which is, with all its mistakes, better informed
than anything of the kind earlier. And then Rymer
falls on <cite>Othello</cite>. He grants it “a phantom of a fable.” But it
is a very bad phantom. Ridiculous that Desdemona should
love a blackamoor at all; more ridiculous that she should be
attracted by his stories of adventure; most that Othello should
be made a Venetian general—and so on throughout. But the
characters are worse. Rymer simply cannot away with Iago;
and this on grounds exquisitely characteristic, not merely of
him but of the whole system, of which he is the <span lang="la"><i>reductio ad absurdum</i></span>.
It is not nearly so much Iago’s <span lang="la"><i>theriotes</i></span> by which
Rymer is shocked, as his violation of the type and the general
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>law. “He would pass upon us a close, dissembling, false, insinuating
rascal instead of an open-hearted, frank, plain-dealing
soldier—a character constantly worn by them for some thousand
years in the world.”<a id='r517'></a><a href='#f517' class='c019'><sup>[517]</sup></a> Again, “Philosophy tells us it is a
principle in the nature of Man to be grateful.... Philosophy
must be [the poet’s] guide,”<a id='r518'></a><a href='#f518' class='c019'><sup>[518]</sup></a> therefore Iago is a poetical impossibility.
Rymer knows that historically all men are <em>not</em> grateful:
but never mind. The Type! the Type! the Type!<a id='r519'></a><a href='#f519' class='c019'><sup>[519]</sup></a> One
need hardly go farther, but in going we cannot, in one sense,
fare worse.<a id='r520'></a><a href='#f520' class='c019'><sup>[520]</sup></a> “Godlike Romans” (as Mr Dryden had already
called them) are, in <cite>Julius Cæsar</cite>, “put in fools’ coats and made
jack-puddings of,” which, says Tom justly, “is a sacriledge.”
Brutus and Cassius “play a prize, a tryal of skill in huffing and
swaggering like two drunken Hectors.” In Tragedy Shakespeare
“appears quite out of his element; his brains are
turned; he raves and rambles without any coherence, any
spark of reason, or any rule to control him, and set bounds to
his frenzy.” Nor does Ben fare much better. He indeed
“knew to distinguish men and manners at another rate.” In
<cite>Catiline</cite> “we find ourselves in Europe, we are no longer in the
land of Savages,” sighs Rymer with relief. Still Ben, too,
“gropes in the dark, and jumbles things together without
head and tail;” he, though not “in the gang of the strolling
fraternity,” like Shakespeare, “must lie a miserable heap of
ruins for want of architecture;” he “sins against the clearest
light and conviction” by “interlarding fiddle-faddle comedy
and apocryphal matters.” And so forth.</p>

<p class='c000'>That Rymer was utterly deaf to the poetry of <cite>Othello</cite>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>and of <cite>Julius Cæsar</cite>, that he thinks “the neighing of a horse
or the howling of a mastiff possesses more meaning”
than Shakespeare’s verse, merely demonstrates that
he understood the language of the beasts and did not
understand that of the man. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Rule of Tom the Second.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It disqualifies him for his business,
no doubt, hopelessly and of itself. But in the nature of
the case we cannot quarrel with him for this Judgment of God;
and, on his own theory, mere poetry is of so little consequence
that it does not much matter. But where he is cast hopelessly
on his own pleadings, where he shows himself (as he has been
called) utterly stupid, is in his inability to understand the fable,
the characters themselves. He cannot see that the very points
which he blunderingly picks out are the <span lang="la"><i>adunata pithana</i></span> of his
own law-giver—the improbabilities or impossibilities made
plausible by the poet’s art; and that the excess of this or
that quality in Iago, in Desdemona, in Othello, is utterly lost
in, or is unerringly adjusted to, their perfect humanity. He is
not bound to feel “the pity of it”—which he quotes, much as
the pig might grunt at the pearl. But he is bound, on Aristotelian,
no less than on the most extreme Romantic, principles,
to feel that universality which Dryden had ascribed a quarter
of a century before, and for all time to come. Therefore, for
once, though no Macaulayan, I venture to indorse my unimportant
name on a dictum of Macaulay’s. I have read several
critics—I trust this book may show sufficiently that this
is no idle boast. I have known several bad critics from Fulgentius
to the Abbé d’Aubignac, and from Zoilus to persons of
our own day, whom it is unnecessary to mention. But I never
came across a worse critic than Thomas Rymer.<a id='r521'></a><a href='#f521' class='c019'><sup>[521]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The Sprat passage<a id='r522'></a><a href='#f522' class='c019'><sup>[522]</sup></a> is of the very first importance in the

careful to point out that this was for the purposes of the Society—for
the improvement not of literature but of science; and he
does not attempt to argue it out at all from the literary side.
The pronouncement expresses the whole sense of the time; it
is epoch-making in the history of literary taste; but it does
not give itself out as literary criticism, though the spirit of it
may be seen in half the literary criticism that follows for nearly
a hundred and fifty years.</p>

<p class='c000'>The infant historians<a id='r523'></a><a href='#f523' class='c019'><sup>[523]</sup></a> also may be pretty briefly despatched.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Edward Phillips.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Edward Phillips, Milton’s nephew, was by all accounts a most
respectable person; and considering the prevalence
of Royalist opinions (especially as he shared them),
he says quite as much about his uncle as could be expected.
Besides, it is just possible that Milton was no more engaging as
an uncle and schoolmaster than he was as a husband and father.
He was not alive when <span lang="la"><cite>Theatrum Poetarum</cite></span><a id='r524'></a><a href='#f524' class='c019'><sup>[524]</sup></a> appeared in the
winter of 1674-75, but the dignity of the opening “Discourse of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>the Poets and Poetry in general” has made some think that he
had had a hand in it. I am not so sure of this. That it is
addressed to Thomas Stanley and Sir Edward Sherburne (each,
for all the learning of the former and the literary merits of
both, among those “rhyming amorists” and Cavaliers whom
Milton certainly disliked, and at least affected to disdain) need
not much matter. But the style, though often ambitious, does
not seem to me above the reach of a man of some learning and
moderate ability, who had been about Milton in his youth for
years, and at intervals afterwards. Such a man would naturally
take the noble-sentiment view of Poetry, talk of the <span lang="la"><i>melior
natura</i></span> and “that noble thing education,” and the like; nor
would he be at a loss for Miltonic precedents of another kind
when he felt inclined to speak of “every single-sheeted pie-corner
poet who comes squirting out an Elegy.” <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His</i> <span lang="la">Theatrum Poetarum.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The
piece is creditable as a whole, and ends with a hesitating
attribution of poetic merit to Spenser and
Shakespeare, in spite of the “rustic obsolete words,” the “rough-hewn
clowterly verse” of the one, and the “unfiled expressions,
the rambling and undigested fancies” of the other. The body
of the book—an alphabetical dictionary, first of ancient then of
modern poets, and lastly of poetesses, alphabetically arranged in
a singularly awkward fashion by their <span lang="la"><i>prænomina</i></span> or Christian
names when Phillips knows these, and by others when he does
not—is much less important. Here again the nephew has been
robbed to give to the uncle the notices of Marlowe and Shakespeare,
in both of which the most noticeable expressions, “Clean
and unsophisticated wit” and “unvulgar style,” apply to Shakespeare
himself. Phillips has undoubted credit for appreciation
of Drummond (whom he had partially edited from the papers
of Scot of Scotstarvit many years earlier) and for singling out
from the work of Wither (which was then a by-word with
Cavalier critics) <cite>The Shepherd’s Hunting</cite> for admiration. But
he is much more of a list-maker than of a critic.</p>

<p class='c000'>William Winstanley (who brought out his <cite>Lives of the Most
Famous English Poets</cite><a id='r525'></a><a href='#f525' class='c019'><sup>[525]</sup></a> some dozen years later, and levied contributions
on Phillips himself in the most nonchalant manner)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>was a mere bookmaker, to whom is assigned the post of
manufacturer for years of “Poor Robin’s Almanack,”
and who did other hack-work. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Winstanley’s</i> Lives.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> His book is chiefly
an unmethodical compilation of anecdotes; and as the lives
of men of letters have always had more attraction than their
works, Winstanley has been found readable. His place here
is simply due to the fact that, putting archaics like Bale and
Pits aside, he is the second English Historian of Poets, if not
of Poetry.</p>

<p class='c000'>In connection with Phillips and Winstanley (whom he
avowedly follows and acridly comments, accusing them at the
same time of having stolen his thunder from a previously
published <cite>Catalogue</cite>) it may be well to notice
Gerard Langbaine, the somewhat famous author of
the <cite>Account of the English Dramatic Poets</cite>.<a id='r526'></a><a href='#f526' class='c019'><sup>[526]</sup></a> <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Langbaine’s</i> Dramatic Poets.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Of real criticism
there is hardly even as much in Langbaine as in his two Esaus
or Jacobs, taking it which way you please. But he is the
spiritual ancestor of too many later critics; and there are still
too many people who confuse his method with that of criticism
for him to be quite left out. That he had a particular animosity
to Dryden<a id='r527'></a><a href='#f527' class='c019'><sup>[527]</sup></a> is less to his discredit than to that of the class to
which he belongs. This kind of parasite usually fastens on the
fattest and fairest bodies presented to it. Langbaine is first of
all a <span lang="fr"><cite>Quellenforscher</cite></span>. Having some reading and a good memory,
he discovers that poets do not as a rule invent their matter, and
it seems to him a kind of victory over them to point out where
they got it. As a mere point of literary history there is of course
nothing to object to in this: it is sometimes interesting, and need
never be offensive. But, as a matter of fact, it too often is made so,
and is always made so in Langbaine. “I must take the freedom
to tell our author that most part of the language is stolen.”
“Had Mr W. put on his spectacles he would have found it
printed thus,” &#38;c., &#38;c. This hole-picking generally turns to
hole-forging; and one is not surprised to find Langbaine, after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>quoting at great length Dryden’s cavillings at the men of
the last age, huddling off as “some praises” the magnificent
and immortal eulogies<a id='r528'></a><a href='#f528' class='c019'><sup>[528]</sup></a> which atone for them. I am afraid that
Dante, if he had known Langbaine, would have arranged a
special <span lang="it"><i>bolgia</i></span> for him; and it would not have lacked later
inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c000'>The only too notable quarrel of the Ancients and Moderns
produced some deservedly famous literature of the critical kind
in England, but its greatest result in that way, <cite>The
Battle of the Books</cite>, will be best noticed, together
with its author’s other works, and in the order rather of its own
publication than of its composition. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Temple.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Nor need the earlier protagonists,
Temple and Bentley, occupy us much; though the
latter will give an opportunity of paying at least respects to a
kind of Criticism of which we have perforce said little. Temple,
a charming writer, and the author, at the close of his critical
<cite>Essay on Poetry</cite>, of one of the most exquisite sentences in
English, is simply a critic <span lang="fr"><i>pour rire</i></span>. The hundred pages of
his <cite>Works</cite><a id='r529'></a><a href='#f529' class='c019'><sup>[529]</sup></a> which are devoted to literature, invited the exercise
of Macaulay’s favourite methods by the enormity of their ignorance,
the complacency of their dogmatism, and the blandness
of their superficiality. Temple has glimmerings—he intimates
pretty plainly some contempt of at least the French “rules”;
but he will still be talking of what he has given himself hardly
the slightest pains to know.</p>

<p class='c000'>This could not be said of Bentley, and the <cite>Phalaris</cite> Dissertation
has been not undeservedly ranked as one of the representative
pieces of critical literature. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Bentley.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It is only
unfortunate that Bentley has meddled so little with
the purely literary side of the matter; and the sense of this misfortune
may be tempered by remembrance of his dealings with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>Milton. He is, however, perfectly right in at least hinting<a id='r530'></a><a href='#f530' class='c019'><sup>[530]</sup></a>
that the Pseudo-Phalaris might have been convicted on literary
counts, as well as on linguistic and chronological, and that, on
grounds of style, the theory of those half-sceptics who attributed
the <cite>Letters</cite> to Lucian was almost worse than the error of the
true believers. That Lucian could have written a line of this
skimble-skamble stuff is simply impossible; and it must always
remain an instance of the slight sense of style possessed by the
Humanists that a really great man of letters, like Politian,
should have given countenance to the absurdity.</p>

<p class='c000'>From any point of critical consideration Collier’s famous
book<a id='r531'></a><a href='#f531' class='c019'><sup>[531]</sup></a> must be a most important document in the History of
Criticism; and though from some such points it may
be of even greater importance than it is to us, we
can in no wise omit it. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Collier’s</i> Short View.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> For it is probably the
earliest instance in our history where a piece of criticism has
apparently changed, to a very great extent, the face of an
important department of literature, and has really had no small
part in bringing about this change. It is, however, indirectly
rather than directly that it concerns us; for it is only here and
there that Collier takes the literary way of attack, and in that
way he is not always, though he is sometimes, happy. Curiously
enough, one of his felicities in this kind has been imputed to
him for foolishness by his great panegyrist. It is not necessary
to feel that sympathy with his opinions on ecclesiastical and
political affairs which Macaulay naturally disclaimed, and
which some others may cheerfully avow, in order to see that
the Tory critic was quite right, and the Whig critic quite
wrong, in regard to the dissertations on the Greek and Latin
Drama. What may be thought of their technical scholarship
does not matter. But Macaulay’s undoubted familiarity with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>the classics must have had a gap in it, and his wide knowledge
of modern literature several much greater gaps, if he did not
know—first, that Collier <em>had</em> ancient criticism on his side, and
secondly, that the allegation of ancient authority and practice
where favourable, the arguing-off of it where inconvenient,
were exactly the things to influence his generation. When
everybody was looking back on the Vossian precept, “Imitate
the Ancients, but imitate them only in what is good,” and
drawing forward to the Popian axiom,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“To copy Nature is to copy <em>them</em>,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>“dissertations on the Greek and Latin Drama” were not otiose
at all, they were absolutely necessary.</p>

<p class='c000'>But for the most part, as is notorious, Collier is as ethical as
Plutarch or Plato. It was desirable that he should be so, and
nobody but a paradoxer will ever defend the style of play-writing
which produced such things as <cite>Limberham</cite>, and <cite>The Old
Bachelor</cite>, and even <cite>The Relapse</cite>—though the first be Dryden’s,
and contain some good things in the characters of Prudence and
Brainsick, though the second show us the dawn of Congreve’s
wit, and though the third contain handfuls of the sprightliest
things in the English language. It is in reference to this last,
by the way, that Collier chiefly quits the path of ethical criticism,
and takes to that of literary, or at least dramatic. There
is hardly a sharper and more well-deserved beating-up of the
quarters of a ragged dramatic regiment anywhere than that (at
p. 212 <i>sq.</i>) on the glaring improbabilities of Vanbrugh’s plot, the
absolute want of connection between the title part of it and the
real fable—Tom Fashion’s cheating his brother of Hoyden—and
the way in which the characters are constantly out of character
in order that the author may say clever things. But Collier
has serious matters on his mind too much to give us a great deal
of this; and the other definitely literary points which I have
noted, in a very careful re-reading of the piece for this book, are
not numerous. I wish he had not called <cite>Love’s Labour’s Lost</cite> (p.
125) “a very silly play”; but how many people were there
then living who would have thought differently? I wish he
had worked out his statement (rather rash from his own point
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>of view) at p. 148, “Poets are not always exactly in rule.” He
might have developed his views on the Chorus (p. 150) interestingly.
I have some other places; but they are not important.
The sum is, that though Collier evidently knew most critical
authorities, from Aristotle and Horace, through Heinsius and
Jonson, to Rapin, and Rymer, and Dryden himself, very well;
though he could (pp. 228, 229) state the Unities, and even argue
for them—this was not his present purpose, which was simply
to cleanse the stage. His interest in other matters in fact
blunted what might have been a keen interest in literature
proper. And this is thoroughly confirmed by study of his
interesting and characteristic <cite>Essays</cite>,<a id='r532'></a><a href='#f532' class='c019'><sup>[532]</sup></a> where, out of more than
five hundred pages, exactly four are devoted to literature, and
these give us nothing but generalities.</p>

<p class='c000'>That Collier’s victory was very mainly due to the fact that
he struck in at the right moment, as spokesman of an already
formed popular opinion, would be a matter of reasonable
certainty in any case; but the certainty is here
historical. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Sir T. P.  Blount.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> One of many proofs at hand is in the curious lighterfull
of critical lumber which Sir Thomas Pope Blount launched
four (or eight?) years before Collier let his fireship drive into
the fleet of the naughty playwrights. In this book,<a id='r533'></a><a href='#f533' class='c019'><sup>[533]</sup></a> dedicated
to Mulgrave, that noble poet himself, Roscommon, Cowley, and
the lately published and immensely influential <cite>Whole Duty of
Man</cite>, are quoted to support the argument that “A poet may
write upon the subject of Love, but he must avoid obscenity.”<a id='r534'></a><a href='#f534' class='c019'><sup>[534]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Sir Thomas, however, comes within the inner, and not merely
the outer, circle of criticism for his aims and his collections,
though certainly not for any critical genius that he displays.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>His “Remarks upon Poetry,” no less than the “Characters and
Censures” which make up the other part of his work, are the
purest compilation: and though we are certainly not without
compilers in these days (what indeed can a Historian of
Criticism do but compile to a great extent?), there are very few
of us who are at once honest enough and artless enough to
follow the method of Blount. Whether he is arguing that
good humour is essentially necessary to a poet (how about the
<span lang="la"><i>genus irritabile</i></span>?) or that a poet should not be addicted to
flattery, or discussing the “Eglogue, Bucholic [sic], or Pastoral,”
whether he is following Phillips and Winstanley and borrowing
from both, in compiling a dictionary of poets, he simply empties
out his common place-book. “Dryden remarks,” “Rapin
observes,” “Mr Cowley tells us,” “Mr Rymer can nowise allow”
(this is happy, for it was habitual with Mr Rymer “nowise to
allow”), such are the usherings of his paragraphs. He is not
uninteresting when he is original (<i>cf.</i> his remarks on Waller);
but one is almost more grateful to him for his collections, which
put briefly, and together, the critical dicta of a vast number of
people. Here we may read, with minimum of trouble, how
Julius Scaliger could not see anything in Catullus but what is
common and ordinary; how Dr Sprat said that till the time of
Henry the Eighth there was nothing wrote in the English
language except Chaucer that a man would care to read twice;
how Scaliger once more, and Petrus Crinitus, and Johannes
Ludovicus Vives, and Eustatius Swartius, thought Claudian
quite in the first rank of poets; how Tanneguy le Fèvre shook
his head over Pindar as having “something too much the air
of the Dithyrambick”; and how Cœlius Rhodiginus was good
enough to find that same Dantes Aligerus, who displeased
others, a “poet not contemptible.”<a id='r535'></a><a href='#f535' class='c019'><sup>[535]</sup></a> These things are infinitely
pleasant to read, and give one a positive affection for Sir Thomas
Pope Blount as one turns them in the big black print of his
handy quarto; yet perhaps it would be excessive to call him a
great critic. What he does, besides providing this <span lang="la"><i>gazophylacium</i></span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>for the connoisseur, is to show how wide the interest in
criticism was.</p>

<p class='c000'>A further turn, and the last in this walk, may be furnished
to us by one of his own quotations (p. 137 of the <cite>Characters
and Censures</cite>) of an answer to the question,
“Whether Milton and Waller were not the best
English poets, and which was the better of the
two?” from <cite>The Athenian Mercury</cite>, vol. v., No. 4. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Periodicals</i>: The Athenian Mercury, <i>&#38;c.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> For this
curious and interesting medley of Dunton’s, and Samuel
Wesley’s, and others’, was almost the first to provide something
in English answering, or that might have answered, to the
<span lang="fr"><cite>Journal des Savants</cite></span> and the <span lang="fr"><cite>Mercure Galant</cite></span>. Actually, the
Mercury was not very literary. I do not pretend to have
examined the original volumes with any very great care. But
in the three copious books which were either directly compiled
out of it, or composed in imitation—<cite>the Athenian Oracle</cite>,<a id='r536'></a><a href='#f536' class='c019'><sup>[536]</sup></a>
<cite>Athenian Sport</cite>, and <cite>The British Apollo</cite>—literature holds no
very large place. The <cite>Oracle</cite> does indeed give at p. 438 a
very elaborate answer to the question, “Whether the Dramatic
Poets of the Last Age exceeded those of this?” and the <cite>Apollo</cite>,
besides a versification of the identical query and answer which
Blount had quoted, contains a long descant on the Origin of
Poetry, and a remarkably shrewd answer to the question,
“Which is the best poet—Boileau, Molière, or La Fontaine?”
But the time of literary periodicals in England was not yet,
though this was the very eve of it: and they must therefore be
postponed.<a id='r537'></a><a href='#f537' class='c019'><sup>[537]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c020'>
<div class='footnote' id='f484'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r484'>484</a>. The chief critical <span lang="la"><i>loci</i></span> in Milton are
all among the best known passages of
his work. They are the peremptory
anathema on rhyme in the prose note
added to <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>, in what Professor
Masson has settled to be the
“Fifth Form of the First Edition”;
the short Defence of Tragedy, wholly
on Italian principles but adapted to
Puritan understandings, prefixed to
<cite>Samson Agonistes</cite>; the first description
of his own studies in <cite>The Reason of
Church Government</cite>; the more elaborate
return upon that subject—a singular
mixture of exquisite phrasing and literary
appreciation with insolent abuse—in
the <cite>Apology for Smectymnuus</cite>
(which is not, as some have thought,
the same thing as <i>The</i> [Platonic]
<i>Apology</i>) and divers clauses in the
<cite>Tractate of Education</cite>, especially the
reference to “Castelvetro, Tasso, and
Mazzoni,” whom he credits with “sublime
art,” and puts on a level with
Aristotle and Horace. We might add
a few casual girds, such as that at the
supposed cacophony of Hall’s “Teach
each” in the <cite>Apology for Smectymnuus</cite>,
which has been compared to Malherbe’s
vellications of Desportes (<i>cf. sup.</i>, p.
245). A complete critical treatise from
him (if only he could have been prevailed
upon to write in a good temper)
would have been of supreme interest:
it is not so certain that it would have
been of supreme value, even if he had
been in that temper.</p>

but a slight apology for sacred verse
(common in his time and natural
from the author of the <cite>Davideis</cite>);
with a slighter seasoning of the also
familiar defence of poetry from being
mere “lying,” in the Preface to the
folio edition of his Poems; some still
slighter remarks on Comedy in that to
<cite>Cutter of Coleman Street</cite>; and hardly
more than a glance at literary education
in his <cite>Proposition for the Advancement
of Experimental Philosophy</cite>. In this

the most egregious of Dryden’s egregious

may over “no, not Du Bartas.” But
though oases are far from rare in what
may seem, to those who know it not,
this thirsty land of criticism, I hardly
know a more delightful “diamond of
the desert” than the refusal to admit
somebody else lest you should have
to admit Dante, and the subsequent
“Dante, Marino, <em>and others</em>.” When
the eye is weary of italic print, or of a
too closely packed quarto page, or of
François Hédelin, Abbé d’Aubignac, in
any type or <em>format</em>, it is pleasant half
to shut it, and let the dream of these
“others” wave before one. I see that
they must have written in Italian; but
other common measure, other link to

one to think that I wish to make
inept and ignoble game of Davenant,
let me observe that he can write admirable
things, worthy a son, in double

<p class='c000'><a href='#r491'>491</a>. This attempt to get Epic as close

<div class='footnote' id='f493'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r493'>493</a>. Of the great critical men of letters
of 1800-1850 only Leigh Hunt—the
least of them—was just to Dryden;
even Hazlitt is inadequate on him.
Among our <i>preceptistas</i> of the same or
a little later date, Keble (<cite>Præl.</cite> v.)
mildly perstringes Dryden’s inconsistency
(“<span lang="la"><i>male sibi constat D.</i></span>”), but
rather as poet than as critic. Garbett,
his successor and opponent, a great
admirer of Dryden’s style, and one who
expresses just regret at the want of
common knowledge of it, is very severe
(<cite>Præl.</cite> x.) on his want of philosophical
profundity and sincerity.  But the
reverend Professor had found nearly as
much fault on this score with Longinus.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f494'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r494'>494</a>. Dryden made no mistake about
Longinus. He calls him, in the <cite>Apology</cite>
prefixed to <cite>The State of Innocence</cite>, “the

<p class='c000'><a href='#r495'>495</a>. Dryden’s critical work, which
until recently was accessible with ease
only in Scott’s elaborate edition of his
works, or in Malone’s less bulky, but
still bulky and not excessively common,
edition of the Prose, has recently been
given, with quite admirable editorial
matter, by Professor Ker (2 vols.,
Oxford, 1900). I wish he had included
one or two more things, especially
the <cite>Heads of an answer to Rymer</cite>;
but it must be admitted that the authenticity
of these, though I think not
doubtful, is not absolutely certain, and
the correct text still less so. See note

Scott, xv. 378 <i>sq.</i>, for text and

No one has vindicated him better
against the half-witted blunderers.
But I am not quite so much inclined as
even Mr Ker is to father his critical

Sarrasin and Scudéry, or on Corneille
himself. It is not till Saint-Evremond,
perhaps even till Fénelon, that I can

<p class='c000'><a href='#r498'>498</a>. I have not thought it necessary to
encumber the page with references in
the case of the shorter Essays, where
any one can discover the passages
cited, whether he uses Scott, Malone,
the originals, or Mr Ker’s special collection,
with no more labour than is

In the case of the longer pieces the

<p class='c000'><a href='#r500'>500</a>. When the present writer began
his revision of Scott’s <cite>Dryden</cite> in the
year 1881 there were no separate
editions of the <cite>Essay</cite> since the originals.
There are now, of annotated
issues of it, either by itself or with
more or less of its author’s related
work, no less than five known to me,—those
of Mr Thomas Arnold (Oxford,
1886), Mr Strunk (New York, 1898),
Mr Low (London, n. d.), Mr Nichol
Smith (Glasgow, 1900), and Professor
Ker’s.  The study of English literature
in schools and colleges has been
much abused, very foolishly talked
about by some of its advocates, and
no doubt not always wisely directed.
But it is at least something to be
said for it that it has made such
a masterpiece as this known to probably
a hundred persons for every
one who knew it twenty years ago.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f501'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r501'>501</a>. One of the very earliest evidences
of the interest in dramatic criticism
felt in England, immediately after the
Restoration, must be Pepys’ note that
on September 1, 1660, when he was
dining at the Bullhead, there “rose
 ... a dispute between Mr Moore and
Dr Clerke—the former affirming that it
was essential to a tragedy to have the
argument of it true, which the Doctor
denied.” The question, on the very
English terms of another dinner and a
bet, was to be settled by Pepys himself
three days later. He does not tell us
whether he read up for it; but on the
4th he decided for the Doctor (<cite>Diary</cite>,
ed. Wheatley, i. 233).</p>

113 Rymer says that he will not here
examine the various qualities which
make English fit above all other
languages for Heroic Poesy, “the
world expecting these matters learnedly
and largely discussed in a particular
treatise on that subject.” This
apparently important announcement is
marginally annotated “Sheringham.”
I suppose this was Robert S., a Norfolk
man (as his name imports), of
Caius College, and Proctor at Cambridge
just before the Commonwealth
ejection. He is described (see <cite>Dict.
Nat. Biog.</cite>) as an “excellent linguist,”
but seems to have been more of an
antiquary than of a man of letters.
As the <cite>D. N. B.</cite> says nothing of any
such work as Rymer glances at, I suppose
the world was disappointed of it
by his sudden death in May 1678, four
years after Rymer wrote.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f513'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r513'>513</a>. I do not think that Rymer ever

criticism (pp. 19-24).</p>

that "if Aristotle had seen
ours [<i>i.e.</i>, "our plays"] he might have
changed his mind." One may add
that, if Dryden had worked these
“Heads” out, he might have solved the
whole mystery of criticism as far as in
all probability it ever can be solved, or
at the very least as far as it could be
solved with the knowledge of literature
at his disposal.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>INTERCHAPTER V.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>In the present Interchapter we come to a sort of Omphalos of
the whole projected History. Here and here only, up to the
present day, do we find a Catholic Faith of criticism, not merely
at last constituted, but practically accepted over the whole
literary world. In ancient times, though it is not difficult to
discern a creed of a not wholly dissimilar character, yet that
creed was arrived at in roundabout fashion, and was never applied
universally to poetry and prose as literature. In the Middle
Ages there was no such creed at all. In the century which—or
rather a certain aspect of it—will furnish us with the subject
of the last Book of the present volume, the catholic faith still
maintains, and even, as is the wont of such things, rather
tightens, its hold as received orthodoxy; but there are grumblings,
and threatenings, and upheavals on the one hand, and on the
other the tendency to a dangerous latitudinarianism. In that
which, with the permission of the fates, will, with the Dissidents
of the Eighteenth, give the subject of the next volume, there is
no parallel consensus even of a prevailing party. Take a dozen
critics of any distinction, at different times and in different
countries of the seventeenth century in Europe, and ask them
to enunciate some general laws and principles of literary
criticism. The results, if not slavishly identical, would be
practically the same, putting aside particular and half unreal
squabbles of Ancient and Modern and the like. Do the same at
any time for the last hundred—certainly for the last seventy or
eighty—years, and the result would be a Babel. If any two of
the utterances did not betray direct contradiction, it would
probably be because the speakers began at entirely different
facets of the subject.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>Whether this literary unanimity—which resembles the ecclesiastical
unanimity, on the ruins of which it grew, not least
in being a little unreal—was a good thing or a bad thing in
itself, is one of those larger questions which we do not purpose
to argue out here. The point for us is that it existed. It was
compatible, as in the other case, with a good deal of minor
difference: there might be literary Scotists and Thomists; there
might even (as in the Ancient and Modern case) be a Great
Schism of the most apparently important kind. But this was
as a rule mere jangling; and the more serious of the Moderns
generally tried to make out little more than that their
favourites could claim as much, or more, of the graces which
both esteemed, as the other people’s favourites possessed.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have seen in the last Interchapter how something like
this creed had been achieved—though not without a good deal
of opposition, and hardly, in any case, with the result of
authoritative and complete statement—in Italy, and to some
extent borrowed thence, in other countries, before the end of
the sixteenth century itself. The seventeenth did little more
than crystallise it, lay stress on particular points, fill up some
gaps, arrange, codify, illustrate. The absence of dissidence,
except on the minor points, is most remarkable. In regard to
Aristotle, in particular, there are no Patrizzis and hardly any
Castelvetros. Men tack on a considerable body of Apocrypha
to the canonical books of the Stagirite, and misinterpret not
a little that he actually said. But they never take his general
authority in question, seldom the authority of any ancient,
and that of Horace least of all. The two great artificial conceptions
of the elaborate “Unities” drama, with Acts and
Scenes taking the place of the choric divisions, and of the still
more artificial “Heroic Poem,” with its Fable, its Epic Unity,
its Machines, and so forth, acquire in theory—if luckily, as, for
instance, in England, by no means in practice—greater and
greater dignity. It becomes a sort of truism that the drama
is the most beautiful and ingenious, the heroic poem the
noblest, thing on which the human mind can exercise itself.
But they are difficult things, sir! very difficult things. Each
is sharply isolated as a Kind: and the other Kinds are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>ranged around and below them. You never criticise any
thing first in itself, but with immediate reference to its Kind.
If it does not fulfil the specifications of that Kind, it is either
cast out at once or regarded with the deepest suspicion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Further, all the Kinds in particular, as well as Poetry itself
in general, possess, and are distinguished by, Qualities which
are, in the same way, rigidly demanded and inquired into.
It is generally, if not quite universally, admitted that a poem
must please: though critics are not quite agreed whether you
are bound to please only so as to instruct. But you must
please in the Kind, by the Quality, according to the Rule.
There is no room for nondescripts; or, if they are admitted at
all, they must cease to be nondescripts, and become Heroi-comic,
Heroi-satiric, “Tragical-comical-historical-pastoral,”<a id='r538'></a><a href='#f538' class='c019'><sup>[538]</sup></a> or
what not.</p>

<p class='c000'>This general view may seem unorthodox to those who put
faith in the notion—to be found in some books of worth, as
well as of worship—that there was a “Romantic revolt” in
the beginning of the seventeenth century—that there was even
a kind of irruption or recrudescence of mediæval barbarism, and
that the pronounced and hardened classicism of the later
century was a fresh reaction—a case of <span lang="fr"><i>Boileau à la rescousse</i></span>!
The texts, and the facts, and the dates, do not, to my thinking,
justify this view of history, in so far, at least, as criticism is
concerned. The crystallising of the classical creed goes on
regardless of Euphuism, earlier and later, in England, of Marinism
in Italy, of Culteranism and Conceptism in Spain, of the
irregular outburst of similar tastes in France, which marks the
reign of Louis XIII. As we have seen, Ogier, in the last
named country, at the very moment of striking a blow for
Romantic drama, admits that the critics are against him; and
we have also seen how they were. In England, Sidney, at
the beginning of the great Elizabethan period, holds out hands
to Jonson at the end. The very Spanish Romantics, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>they come to consider the matter critically, make an unblushing
transaction between conscientious theory and popular
practice: and such an Italian iconoclast as Beni is classical, in
the very act and process of belittling the classics.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the same time, this accepted faith of Criticism, when we
come to examine it, is a very peculiar Catholicity. Uncompromisingly
Aristotelian in profession, its Aristotelianism, as
has been recognised by an increasing number of experts from
the time of Lessing downwards, is hopelessly adulterated.
Many of the insertions and accretions are purely arbitrary:
others come from a combination of inability to forget, and
obstinate refusal frankly to recognise, the fact that the case
is quite a different case from that which Aristotle was diagnosing.
But, by the time at least when the creed became
triumphant, a new Pope, a new Court of Appeal, has been
foisted in, styling itself Good Sense, Reason, or even (though
quite Antiphysic) Nature. That this anti-Pope, this Antiphysis,
was partly created by the excesses of the Euphuist-Gongorist
movements, need not be denied; but this is comparatively
irrelevant. We have traced above, in almost all their principal
exponents, the curious, and sometimes very ludicrous, attempt
to conciliate that <span lang="la"><i>furor poeticus</i></span> which the ancients had never
denied, with those dictates of good sense which the ancients
were presumed to have accepted and embodied. A professed
satirist could evolve, in his happiest moments, nothing more
comic than the eirenicon of Mambrun,<a id='r539'></a><a href='#f539' class='c019'><sup>[539]</sup></a> or, rather, than his
clinical examination of the poet in fury, and his observation of
the poet in his right mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>The survey of the development of this phenomenon, or group
of phenomena, in different countries, requires less minuteness
than was needed in the last Interchapter, because the central
stage of the movement is both of less importance and of less
complexity than the beginnings of it: but it is essential to
the scheme of these Interchapters, and to that of the whole
book, that some such survey should be given.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Italy, as we have seen, the results of the period were
almost insignificant—a fact no doubt connected with, though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>in no sense necessarily caused by, the declension of the Italian
creative genius after Tasso. We have, it may be hoped, established,
by the slow but irresistible process of reciting the actual
history, the truth that no constant ratio exists between periods
of creation and periods of criticism—that they may go hand in
hand, or that one may follow the other, or that both may fail
to put in any important appearance, as Fate and metaphysical
aid may determine. This, for Italy, was a period of the last
kind, though not one of its very worst examples. The Italians
continued both to play at criticism in their Academies, and to
accumulate solid though second-hand work in such laboratories
as those of Aromatari. They fought out the half-mock battle of
the Ancients and Moderns, as became them, before other nations
meddled with it: and they still maintained, for long, though
not for the whole time, that position of supremacy, as masters
in title to Europe, which the great achievements of the preceding
century had given them. But they added nothing to their
claims, and by degrees the supremacy passed from them.<a id='r540'></a><a href='#f540' class='c019'><sup>[540]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>That it passed to France is an accepted truth, and like most,
though not all, accepted truths, this has so much of the real
quality that it is idle to cavil at it. That it has been abused
there can be little doubt—or could be little if people would take
the small trouble necessary to ascertain the facts. I do not
know who first invented the term “Gallo-Classic,” which, to
judge by those Röntgen rays which the reader of examination-papers
can apply, has sunk deep into the youthful mind of this
country. It is a bad word. I have taken leave to call it
“question-begging, clumsy, and incomplete,” before now; and I
repeat those epithets with a fresh emphasis here. It begs the
question whether “Italo-Classic” would not, in its own kind, be
the properer term: it is clumsy because the two parts of it are
not used in the same sense; and it is incomplete because it does
not intimate that much beside French influence, and that a very
peculiar and sophisticated kind of Classical influence, went to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>the making of the thing. But there <em>was</em> French influence: and
for some three-quarters of a century France was the head manufactory
in which Italian, Classical, and other ideas were torn up
and remade into a sort of critical shoddy with which (as with
other French shoddy in that and other times) Europe was rather
too eager to clothe itself. Some pains have been taken in the
foregoing Book to put the reader in a position to appreciate the
real rise, progress, and history of French criticism of the Neo-classic<a id='r541'></a><a href='#f541' class='c019'><sup>[541]</sup></a>
type. The survey, whatever difference may exist as to
its justice in matter of opinion, will not, I think, be found erring
in matters of fact: and it will show that the position usually
accorded to Boileau requires some reconsideration. But Boileau
was undoubtedly the greatest man of letters who, holding these
views, devoted himself specially and definitely to the expression
of them; and, for good or for ill, his name is associated with the
movement. I agree with Keats,<a id='r542'></a><a href='#f542' class='c019'><sup>[542]</sup></a> who here, as in so many other
matters, came right by genius. Those of us who do not possess
this royal key can, at any rate, if we choose to take the trouble,
come right by knowledge.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Quarrel of the Ancients and Moderns—though we have
spoken hard words of it—might look like revolt against the
tyranny of Despréaux, and it undoubtedly spread seeds of the
more successful revolution which followed; but the more one
studies it, the more one sees that the revolt was in the main
unconscious. As we have partly shown, and as might be shown
much more fully, the Moderns were, as a rule, just as “classical”
in their ideas as the Ancients. They were as incapable of
catholic judgment; they were even more ignorant of literature
as a whole: they were at least as apt to introduce non-literary
criteria; they were as much under the obsession of the Kind,
the Rule (cast-iron, not leaden), the sweeping generalisation.
Too commonly the thing comes to this—that the man who can
conjugate <i>tupto</i> will not hear of anything which lessens the
importance of that gift, and that the man who cannot conjugate
<i>tupto</i> will not hear of any virtue attaching to it.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>Most other countries require little notice here. The Germans
make practically no figure; the Dutch confine themselves to
classical study and the popularisation of reviewing; and the
Spaniards, with characteristic indolence, refuse to work out the
interesting problem presented to them by the recalcitrance of
their national drama to the consecrated ideas of the general
creed. England is of more importance. I have tried to show
that it is of very much more; but this importance belongs
entirely to one man. This one man in his time played many
parts: and as the main aim of literature is to give pleasure, and
to produce original sources thereof, we cannot perhaps say that
his critical part was the greatest. But we may almost say that
it was the most important. We can imagine English literature
without the poetry of Dryden: it would be wofully impoverished,
but somebody would take up the burden, probably before Pope.
Certainly Pope would take it up, though with much more to do.
But English criticism, and, what is more, European criticism of
the best and most fruitful kind, would have had, if Dryden had
been absent, to seek some totally new source: and it is impossible
to tell where that source would have been found. There
is no precedent—Lilius Giraldus and Patrizzi between them
might have produced one in Italy, but it is of the highest
significance that they did not—for Dryden’s peculiar way of
shaking different literatures and different examples of literature
together, of indicating the things that please him in all, and of
at least attempting to find out why they please him. It is this,
not his parade of Rules, and his gleanings from the books, that
makes his critical glory: and it is this in which, among critics
up to his own time, he is alone.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet even he does parade “rules”; even he does belaud
Rapin, and Le Bossu, and even Rymer; even he would have
been, no doubt, quite as ready to take the oath to Boileau as
he was nobly determined not to take it to William. His
genius is recalcitrant to the orthodoxy of the time; but something
else in him accepts it. It is not for nothing that he
never <em>published</em> that word of power which dissolves all the
spells of Duessa—“Had Aristotle seen our plays he might
have changed his mind.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>That, however, there was, at any rate in the earlier part of
the time, much blind, and even a little conscious revolt against
classicism, independent of the Ancient and Modern quarrel, is
not to be wholly denied. I have hinted doubts as to the correctness
of regarding the Euphuist-Metaphysical extravagances in
England, Marinism in Italy, Gongorism in Spain, and the
fantastic and “precious” fancies which mark the reign of
Louis XIII. and the Fronde in France, as either deliberate
reactions against classicism, or abortive births and false dawns
of Romance. They are in almost every case direct results of
the Romantic or mediæval side of the earlier Renaissance—last
things, not first. But, by the end of the century, they
were almost everywhere got well under; though in Spain,
their greatest stronghold, it was not till the eighteenth century
itself was some way advanced that Luzán administered the
critical <span lang="fr"><i>miséricorde</i></span>, or, if we must use the language of
the country, played <span lang="es"><i>despeñador</i></span> to them. Any other interpretation
of the phenomena seems to me to distort them and
make them unintelligible, while the procession of the Metaphysical
from the Spenserian stage, of Marinism from Tasso,
of Gongorism from the great Spanish age, and of the French
extravagants from the Spaniards and Marino, working not a
little on the Pléiade itself, is natural, historical, and consistent
with logic. But these very facts prepare and lead up
to the triumph of Neo-Classicism.</p>

<p class='c000'>By dint, however, of these actions and interactions, there was
actually evolved, towards the end of the century, a sort of false
Florimel or Duessa, who was called Taste. She was rather a
Protean Goddess, and reflected the knowledge or the want of it,
the real taste or the want of it, possessed by her priests and
worshippers. The Taste of Dryden and the Taste of Rymer
are two totally different things; there is even a very considerable
difference between the taste of Hédelin and the taste
of Bouhours. But in all save the very happiest minds the
Taste of this time, as far as Poetry is concerned almost
wholly, and to a great extent as regards prose, is vitiated by
all manner of mistaken assumptions, polluted by all manner of
foolish and hurtful idolatries. There is the Idol of the Kind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>which has been noticed; the Idol of the Quality; the Idol of
Good Sense, the most devouring of all.<a id='r543'></a><a href='#f543' class='c019'><sup>[543]</sup></a> It is agreed, and agreed
very pardonably, that it is not well to write</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And periwig with snow the baldpate woods.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>But the baser folk go on from this—and all but the very noblest
have some difficulty in preventing themselves from going on—to
think that a man should not write</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The multitudinous seas incarnadine.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>There is a sense, and a very proper sense, that, in a certain
general way, style must suit subjects: that you ought not to
write to a Child of Quality, aged five, as you would do to Queen
Anne, aged fifty.<a id='r544'></a><a href='#f544' class='c019'><sup>[544]</sup></a> But this topples over into the most absurd
limitations, so that, a little later than our actual time, we shall
find Pope taking modest credit to himself with Spence for that,
though Virgil in his Pastorals “has sometimes six or eight lines
together <em>that are epic</em>,” he had been so scrupulous as “scarce
ever to have two together, even in the <cite>Messiah</cite>.” Indeed it is
hardly possible to find a better <span lang="la"><i>reductio ad absurdum</i></span> of Neo-Classicism
than this. You lay down (as we saw long ago that
Servius did lay it down), from a general induction of the
practice of a particular poet, such and such a rule about
Virgil’s styles in his various works. Then you turn this
individual observation into a general rule. And then you go
near to find fault with the very poet from whom you have
derived it because he does not always observe it—as if his
unquestionable exceptions had not as much authority as his
supposed rules. Nor is there any doubt that this fallacy
derives colour and support from the false Good Sense, the
Pseudo-Reason. The induction from practice is hitched on to
Reason so as to become a deduction and a demonstration, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>once established as that, you deduce from it anything you like.
Meanwhile Good Sense, as complaisant to the critic as stern to
the victim of his criticism, will approve or disapprove anything
that you choose to approve or disapprove, will set her seal to
any arbitrary decision, any unjust or purblind whim, and can
only be trusted with certainty to set her face invariably against
the highest poetry, and often against certain kinds not so high.<a id='r545'></a><a href='#f545' class='c019'><sup>[545]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The result of all this is that, with the exception of Dryden
and somewhat later Fontenelle (see next Book), hardly any
critics of the time achieve, with any success, the highest function
of the true critic of literature, the discovery and celebration of
beautiful literary things. It is not their business, or their wish,
to set free the “lovely prisoned soul of Eucharis.” If Eucharis
will get a ticket from the patronesses of the contemporary
Almack’s, and dress herself in the prescribed uniform, and come
up for judgment with the proper courtesy, they will do her such
justice as Minerva has enabled them to do; but if not, not.
Sometimes (as in the case of the immortal Person of Quality
who took the trouble to get Spenser into order<a id='r546'></a><a href='#f546' class='c019'><sup>[546]</sup></a>) they will good-naturedly
endeavour to give her a better chance, poor thing!
But they will never kiss the Daughter of Hippocrates on the
mouth, and receive the reward thereto appropriated.<a id='r547'></a><a href='#f547' class='c019'><sup>[547]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>That, on the other hand, there is observable, throughout the century,
a certain interpenetration of the older and more Romantic
spirit—in the creative work chiefly, but even there dying down,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>in the critical overmastered from the first, and less and less
perceptible,—this opinion will meet with no contradiction here,
but, on the contrary, with the strongest support. All the
eccentric phenomena, as they may be called, which have
been noticed from Euphuism to Gongorism, are symptoms of
this on the larger scale; and other things—the fancy of Chapelain
himself for the Romances, the lingering attraction which
Gongorism exercises even on such a man as Bouhours—confirm
it. Yet even this was, as has been said, steadily dying down;
and by the end of the century the old Phœnix was nearly in
ashes, though the new bird was to take slow rebirth from them.
I am myself inclined to think that the signs of Romantic
leaning in Dryden belong to the new, not to the old, chapter
of symptoms; and that in this way England, the last, save
perhaps Spain, to give up, was the first to feel again for, the
standard of Romanticism. But in this Dryden was in advance,
not merely of all his countrymen, but of all Europe; and he
did not himself definitely raise any flag of revolt. On the contrary,
he always supposed himself to be, and sometimes was,
arguing for a reasonable and liberal Classicism.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was not in flippancy, but in logical connection with the
present subject, that attention was drawn above<a id='r548'></a><a href='#f548' class='c019'><sup>[548]</sup></a> to a certain
<span lang="la"><i>aporia</i></span> of Tassoni’s on the admitted lovesomeness, body and
soul, of <span lang="fr"><i>le donne brutte</i></span>, and on the tricks which <span lang="it"><i>bruttezza</i></span> and
<span lang="it"><i>bellezza</i></span> play to each other. If that ingenious poet and polemic
had but pushed his inquiries a little further, and extended them
in purview as well as lineally, he might have come to great
things in criticism. It might, for instance, have struck him
whether the accepted notions of literary beauty were not
peculiarly like those of physical beauty, which were also those
of his century. These laws laid it down that “from the chin to
the pit betwixt the collar-bones there must be two lengths of the
nose,” that the whole figure must be “ten faces high,” and that “the
inside of the arm, from the place where the muscle disappears to
the middle, is four noses”; while the careful calculators noted
all the while with dismay that both the Apollo Belvidere and
the Medicean Venus set these proportions at the most godlike
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>defiance.<a id='r549'></a><a href='#f549' class='c019'><sup>[549]</sup></a> He would (or he might) have observed that,
just as when you have settled exactly what a <span lang="it"><i>bella donna</i></span> must
not have, there is apt to sail, or slip, into the room somebody
with that particular characteristic to whom you become a hopeless
slave, so, when you have settled the qualifications of the
drama with the infallibility of Hédelin, and those of the Epic
with the finality of Le Bossu, there comes you out some impudent
production which is an admirable poem, while the obedient
begettings of your rules are worthless rubbish. Tassoni, I say,
might have done this; he seems to have had quite the temper
to do it; but he did it not. It was doubtless with him, as with
others, a case of <span lang="la"><i>Di terrent et Jupiter hostis</i></span>—the gods of their
world and their time forbade them.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the angry gods were not wholly able to maintain their
anger; and at the other end of the century, in that Quarrel of
the Ancients and Moderns which, for all its irritating <span lang="la"><i>ignorationes
elenchi</i></span>, did certainly assist in the discussion of general
æsthetic problems, we find, among other glimpses, an advance,
though only a partial advance, on this suggestion of the <span lang="it"><cite>Pensieri</cite></span>.
Perrault, who doubtless knew Tassoni (one of his brothers
had translated the <span lang="it"><cite>Secchia</cite></span>), has a curious passage on the diversity
of the forms of feminine beauty. He had,<a id='r550'></a><a href='#f550' class='c019'><sup>[550]</sup></a> he says, visited
the gallery of a connoisseur who had collected portraits of the
most famous beauties of Europe for a century past. There were
not two of the same type of loveliness; and of the spectators
there were not two who fixed on the same portrait as the most
beautiful. But Perrault, though he has had this glimpse of the
true path opened up to him, does not dare pursue it. He is as
convinced as the rest of them that you can reduce ideas of
beauty to a minimum which is always invariable, though you
may add others which vary; and he is perfectly arbitrary in his
admissions and exclusions of these latter. He hates Gothic
architecture; it may be strongly suspected that he would fall
far short of Chapelain in appreciating Romance, for all his fairy
tales. His criticisms of the Ancients belie his theory itself; for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>he will not open his eyes to see the beauty of their peculiarity.
His remarks on Homer are pitiable. My always estimable and
not seldom admirable predecessor, Blair, was no doubt sadly
“left to himself” when he selected,<a id='r551'></a><a href='#f551' class='c019'><sup>[551]</sup></a> as the awful example of a
man of bad taste, the person who said that Homer was no
better than “some old tale of chivalry.” But Perrault, I fear,
is a more terrible spectacle when he says that none of the Three
Tragedians will bear comparison with Corneille (and I think I
may claim the merit of not undervaluing Corneille), that nobody
but professed scholars can read Aristophanes, and that
Ovid is the inferior of Benserade. When we read these things—and
except in Fontenelle, the eternal exception, they are to
be found in every espouser of the Modern side, just as the corresponding
absurdities are to be found in every defender of the
Ancients—there is nothing to say but “This is all out of focus.
Both of you see men as trees walking.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A summary of the whole merits and defects of neo-classicism
must again be postponed; though with no further prorogation
than to the end of the next Book and the present volume. As
for the special defects of this special period we have said enough;
and we may conclude this Interchapter with a glance at its
special merits. They are partly of a negative kind, but they
certainly exist. In the Middle Ages, as we have seen, there
was no code of criticism at all; in the sixteenth century only
a growing approach to one, though the approach had become
very near at the last. Some outbreaks of heterodoxy—the last
stand of Romance for the time—had, as usually happens, drawn
the orthodox together, had made them sign a definite, or almost
definite, instrument or confession. Just or unjust, adequate or
inadequate, even consistent or inconsistent, as it may be, from
the point of view of a very searching and all-inspecting logic,
the neo-classicism of the late seventeenth century was a thing
about which there could be no mistake. It knew its own mind
about everything which it chose to consider, and valiantly shut
its eyes to everything which it chose to ignore. For a time—a
short time only, of course, for the triumph of a religion is
always the signal for the appearance of a heresy—the majority of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>people had not much more doubt about what was the proper thing
to believe in and admire in literature, than they had about the
multiplication table. It became possible—and it was done, as
we shall see, first in Italy, then elsewhere—to write real literary
histories: it became still more easily possible to criticise new
books on a certain basis of accepted postulates. And it is by no
means certain that this provisional orthodoxy was not a necessary
condition of the growth of the new study of Æsthetic,
which, though it has done criticism harm as well as good, has
certainly done it good as well as harm.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor is it possible to deny that there was something to admire
in the creed itself. It was weakest—it was in fact exceedingly
weak—on the poetical side; but the world happened to have
accumulated a remarkably good stock of poetry in the last two
centuries or so, and a fallow, or a cessation of manufacture, was
not undesirable. Prose, on the other hand, had never been got
into proper order in the vernaculars; and it was urgently desirable
that it should be so got. The very precepts of the
classical creed which were most mischievous in poetry were
sovereign for prose. Here also they might hinder the development
of eccentric excellence; but it was not eccentric excellence
that was wanted. Unjust things have been said about the
poetry of the Augustan ages; just things may be said against
the criticism which mainly controlled that poetry. But it is
hardly excessive to say that every precept—not purely metrical—contained
in the <cite>Arts</cite> of Boileau and of Pope, is just and true
for Prose. You may fly in the face of almost every one of these
precepts and be the better poet for it; fly in the face of almost
any one of them in prose, and you must have extraordinary
genius if you do not rue it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Even as to poetry itself some defence may be made. This
poetry needed these rules; or rather, to speak more critically,
these rules expressed the spirit of this poetry. The later and
weaker metaphysicals in England, and fantasts in France, the
Marinists and Gongorists in Spain and Italy, had shown what
happens when <span lang="la"><i>Furor [vere] Poeticus</i></span> ceases to ply the oars, and
Good Sense has not come to take the helm. It is pretty certain
that if this criticism had not ruled we should not have had good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>or great Romantic poetry; we should at best have had (to take
England) a few more Dyers and Lady Winchelseas. But if it
had not ruled we should have had a less perfect Pope and less
presentable minorities of this kind, and have been by no means
consoled by a supply of eighteenth-century Clevelands. Once
more, the period has the criticism that it wants, the criticism
that will enable it to give us its own good things at their own
best, and to keep off things which must almost certainly have
been bad.</p>

<p class='c004'>The death of Dryden punctuates, with an exactness not often
attainable in literary history, the division between seventeenth-
and eighteenth-century literature in England.<a id='r552'></a><a href='#f552' class='c019'><sup>[552]</sup></a> <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Criticism at Dryden’s death.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In general letters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>it is succeeded—not at all immediately—by the great school of
Queen Anne men. In criticism<a id='r553'></a><a href='#f553' class='c019'><sup>[553]</sup></a> one of the greatest
of these, a special pupil of Dryden, takes up the
running at this interval, and others a little later;
but the succession is steadily maintained. Dennis, an unhappily
belated person, continues his exercitations; but has
very much the worse fortune, critical as well as pecuniary, in
his later days. And in the very year of the death there appears
an egregious work—extremely popular, maleficently powerful
beyond all doubt throughout the eighteenth century, and now
chiefly known to non-experts in our days by the humorous
contradiction which gave its author’s name to Shelley, and
by the chance which made a literary connection, towards the
very end of its period of influence, between three such extraordinarily
assorted persons as Afra Behn, Bysshe himself, and
William Blake.<a id='r554'></a><a href='#f554' class='c019'><sup>[554]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Edward Bysshe’s <cite>Art of English Poetry</cite><a id='r555'></a><a href='#f555' class='c019'><sup>[555]</sup></a> puts the eighteenth-century
theory of this art with a rigour and completeness which
can only be attributed either to something like genius,
or to a wonderful and complete absence of it. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Bysshe’s</i> Art of English Poetry.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> His
<cite>Rules for Making English Verse</cite> are the first part
of the book in order, but much the least in bulk.
Then follow, first a collection of “the most natural and sublime
thoughts of the best English poets,” or, in other words, an
anthology, reasoned under headings, from poets of the seventeenth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>century, extending to about four hundred and fifty pages;
and last a Dictionary of Rhymes. The “best English poets”
may be useful to give in a note.<a id='r556'></a><a href='#f556' class='c019'><sup>[556]</sup></a> The Dictionary is preceded
by a few prefatory remarks, including one important historically,
“Rhyme is <em>by all</em> allowed to be the chief ornament of
versification in the modern languages.” The killing frost which
had fallen on the flowers of Elizabethan poetry had killed one
weed at any rate—the craze against rhyme.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rules are preceded by a partly apologetic Preface, which
disclaims any wish to furnish tools to poetasters, and puts the
work “under the awful guard of the immortal Shakespeare,
Milton [note that this was before Addison’s critique], Dryden,
&#38;c.” The keynote is struck, in the very first sentence of the
text, with that uncompromisingness which makes one rather
admire Bysshe. “The Structure of our verses, whether blank
or in rhyme, consists <em>in a certain number of syllables; not</em> in
feet composed of long and short syllables, as the verse of the
Greeks and Romans.” And he adds that, though some ingenious
persons formerly puzzled themselves in prescribing rules for
the quantity of English syllables, and composed verses by the
measure of dactyls and spondees, yet that design is now wholly
exploded. In other words, he cannot conceive classical feet
without classical arrangement of feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Our poetry admits, for the most part, of but three sorts of
verses, those of 10, 8, and 7 syllables. Those of 4, 6, 9, 11, 12,
and 14 are generally employed in masks and operas.” But 12
and 14 may be used in Heroic verse with grace. Accent must
be observed; and the Pause <em>must be</em> at or near the middle,
though in Heroics it may be at the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, or 7th
syllable, determined by the seat of the accent. Still, pauses at
the 3rd and 7th must be used sparingly. The 2nd and 8th
“can produce no true harmony”; and he seems to have refused
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>to contemplate anything so awful as a pause at the 1st or 9th.
After decasyllables, octosyllables are commonest. As for lines
of 9 and 11 syllables, “with the accent on the last [<i>i.e.</i>, anapæstic
measures], the disagreeableness of their measure has
wholly excluded them from serious subjects.” The refining
effected since the days of Chaucer, Spenser, and other ancient
poets consists especially in the avoidance of the concourse of
vowels and in the rigid elision of the article, the contraction of
preterperfect tenses (“amaz’d,” not “amazed”), the rejection of
alliteration (an instance in Dryden is apologised for), of splitting
words closely connected at the end of a verse, and of
polysyllables.</p>

<p class='c000'>And a very large number of minute rules follow, the one
guiding principle of which is to reduce every line to its
syllabic minimum, never allowing trisyllabic substitution.</p>

<p class='c000'>The book, base and mechanical as it may seem, is of the
first historical importance. It will be seen, even from these
few extracts, that the excellent Bysshe has no doubts, no half-lights.
The idea, which we have seen crystallising for a
century and a half, that English poetry is as strictly and
inexorably syllabic as French, and much more so than Greek
or Latin, is here put in its baldest crudity. Bysshe will have
no feet at all: and no other division within the line but at the
pause, which is to be as centripetal as possible, like the French
cæsura. It follows from this that, except the feminine or double
ending, which is allowed ostensibly as a grace to rhymes, though
also in blank verse, nothing extra to the ten, the eight, or
whatever the line-norm may be, is permitted on any account.
Articles, prepositions that will stand it, pronouns, are to be
rigidly elided; weak or short syllables in the interior of words
must be slurred out. There is (only that Bysshe will not have
even the name of foot) no room for a trisyllabic foot anywhere,
in what he equally refuses to call iambic or trochaic verse.</p>

<p class='c000'>But what is more startling still is that trisyllabic feet disappear,
not merely from the octosyllable and the heroic, but
from English prosody, or are admitted only to “Compositions
for Musick and the lowest sort of burlesque.” Dryden might
have written, “After the pangs of a desperate lover”; Prior
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>might be writing “Dear Chloe, how blubbered is that pretty
face”: but Bysshe sternly averts <em>his</em> face from them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, if this astonishing impoverishment of English poetry
had been the isolated crotchet of a pedant or a poetaster, it
would at most deserve notice in a note. But it was nothing
of the kind. “He,” this insignificant person, “said it”: they
went and did it. It expressed the actual poetic practice of
serious poets from Pope to Goldsmith: and it expressed the
deliberate theoretic creed of such a critic as Johnson. The
contrary practice of the great old poets was at best a “licence,”
at worst a “fault.” What had actually happened to French—that
it had been reduced to the iamb—what Gascoigne had
lamented and protested against, long before, was here threatened—or
rather, with bland ignoring, even of threat, laid down—as
the unquestioned and unquestionable law of English. The
whole eighteenth century did not, indeed, go the entire length
of Bysshe. Prior—it is his everlasting glory in English poetical
history—took care of that, and not only saved anapæstic
cadence for us, but made it more popular than ever. But
the eighteenth century continued, charmingly as it wrote them,
to be a little ashamed of its anapæsts, to write them affectedly
as a relaxation, if not even a derogation—to indulge in them
(just as it might indulge in leap-frog with wig and long-skirted
coat laid aside) avowedly for a frolic. And about the
decasyllable—not quite so rigidly about the octosyllable—it
accepted Bysshe almost without a protest. All the infinite
variety of true English prosody, all the gliding or melting
trochees, all the passion and throb which trisyllabic feet give
to iambic verse, were sacrificed, all freedom of pause was relinquished,
and the decasyllable tramped, the octosyllable
tripped, as regularly and as monotonously as a High Dutch
grenadier or a Low Dutch clock.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bysshe had been frankly formal; it is not a small merit in
him that he knew what he had to do and did it: but persons
who were little if at all above him in taste or in
intellect affected to despise him for this, and Mr
Charles Gildon in his <cite>Complete Art of Poetry</cite>,<a id='r557'></a><a href='#f557' class='c019'><sup>[557]</sup></a> published a few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>years later, is very high and mighty with Bysshe. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Gildon.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> As for
himself he does not think that Poetry consists even in “colouring,”
but in Design: and he hashes up his French originals
into some would-be modish dialogues, in which ladies of
fashion attack and defend poetry on the old lines, before he
comes to minuter recommendations. These differ chiefly from
Bysshe’s in that they are wordier, less peremptory, and given
to substitute the vagueness of the journalist for the precision of
the schoolmaster. Nor was this by any means Gildon’s only
contribution to criticism. Among the others perhaps the most
interesting is an anonymous and undated, but apparently not
doubtful, <span lang="it"><i>rifacimento</i></span> of Langbaine,<a id='r558'></a><a href='#f558' class='c019'><sup>[558]</sup></a> which is curious as an
example of <span lang="fr"><i>peine du talion</i></span>. Gildon (who has employed his
own or some other “careful hand” to give himself an ingeniously,
because not extravagantly, complimentary notice in the
Appendix) serves Langbaine in Langbaine’s own fashion; and,
not contented with reversing his judgments, indulges freely in
such phrases as “Mr Langbain mistakes,” “those scurrilous
and digressory remarks with which Mr Langbain has bespattered
him [Dryden],” &#38;c. The book is in the main bibliographic
and biographic rather than critical.</p>

<p class='c000'>A name which has something to do with criticism, and
which associates itself naturally with those of Dennis and
Gildon in the regiment of Pope’s victims, is that
of Leonard Welsted, who in 1712 published a
translation of Longinus, “with some remarks on the English
Poets.” <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Welsted.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Welsted’s translation, whether made directly from the
Greek or not,<a id='r559'></a><a href='#f559' class='c019'><sup>[559]</sup></a> is readable enough, and his alternative title,
“A treatise on <em>the Sovereign Perfection of Writing</em>,” is not
unhappy. Neither are his Preface and his appended “Remarks”
contemptible. He can appreciate not merely Milton but
Spenser; is (how unlike Rymer!) transported with <cite>Othello</cite>, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>especially with its conclusion; and if he is not superior to
others in scorning “Latin rhymes,” at least has sufficient
independence to be very irreverent to Buchanan.</p>

<p class='c000'>But there was a contemporary of Bysshe’s, more famous
than either Gildon or Welsted, whose soul was equally above
mere prosodic precept, and to whom, as it happens, Gildon
himself pays a compliment, as to a denizen of Grub Street, of
whom Grub Street could not but feel that he did it some
honour by herding with its more native and genuine <a id='corr431.9'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='population'>population.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_431.9'><ins class='correction' title='population'>population.</ins></a></span>
Of him we must say something—not, as we might almost
have said it, in juxtaposition with the great poet and critic
whom he had earlier admired, but before coming to the lesser,
but still great, successors of Dryden, with whom he came into
collision in his evil days.</p>

<p class='c000'>If John Dennis had been acquainted with the poetry of
Tennyson (at which he would probably have railed in his best
manner, in which he would certainly have detected
plagiarisms from the classics), he too might have applied
to himself the words of Ulysses, “I am become a name.”
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Dennis.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Everybody who has the very slightest knowledge of English
literature knows, if only in connection with Dryden, Addison,
and Pope, the surly, narrow, but not quite ignorant or incompetent
critic, who in his younger and more genial days admired
the first, and in his soured old age attacked the second and
third. But it may be doubted whether very many persons have
an acquaintance, at all extensive, with his works. They were
never collected; the <cite>Select Works of John Dennis</cite><a id='r560'></a><a href='#f560' class='c019'><sup>[560]</sup></a> mainly consist
of his utterly worthless verse. Much of the criticism is hidden
away in prefaces which were seldom reprinted, and the original
editions of which have become very rare. Even good libraries
frequently contain only two or three out of more than a dozen
or a score of separate documents: and though the British
Museum itself is well furnished, it is necessary to range through
a large number of publications to obtain a complete view of
Dennis as a critic.</p>

<p class='c000'>That view, when obtained, may perhaps differ not a little
from those which have, in a certain general way, succeeded each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>other in current literary judgment. During the reign of Pope
and Addison, the scurrilous assailant of the first, and the more
courteous but in part severe censor of the second, was naturally
regarded as at best a grumbling pedant, at worst a worthless
Zoilus. The critics of the Romantic school were not likely to
be much attracted by Dennis. More recently, something of a
reaction has taken place in his favour; and it has become not
unusual to discover in him, if not exactly a Longinus or a
Coleridge, yet a serious and well-equipped critic, who actually
anticipated not a little that after-criticism has had to say.<a id='r561'></a><a href='#f561' class='c019'><sup>[561]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>That this more charitable view is not entirely without foundation
may be at once admitted. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>On Rymer.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> As compared with Rymer, in
whose company he too often finds himself in modern
appreciation, Dennis shows, indeed, pretty well. He
very seldom—perhaps nowhere—exhibits that crass insensibility
to poetry which distinguishes “the worst critic who ever
lived.” One of his earliest and not his worst pieces, <cite>The Impartial
Critic</cite> of 1693, is an answer to Rymer himself, points
out with acuteness and vigour that “Tom the Second” would
ruin the English stage if he had his way, and even approaches
the sole causeway of criticism across the deep by advancing the
argument that the circumstances of the Greek drama were perfectly
different from those of the English.<a id='r562'></a><a href='#f562' class='c019'><sup>[562]</sup></a> Yet already there
are danger-signals. That the piece (which includes a Letter to
a Friend and some dialogues) contains a great deal of clumsy
jocularity, does not much matter. But when we find Dennis
devoting some of this jocularity to Antigone’s lamentation over
her death unwedded, we feel sadly that the man who can write
thus is scarcely to be trusted on the spirit of poetry. And the
admission that Rymer’s censures of Shakespeare are “in most
of the particulars very sensible and just” is practically ruinous.<a id='r563'></a><a href='#f563' class='c019'><sup>[563]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>Dennis’s answer to Collier is a little later,<a id='r564'></a><a href='#f564' class='c019'><sup>[564]</sup></a> but still earlier
than most of his better known work; and it is very characteristic
of his manner, which has not often, I think, been exactly
described. As elsewhere, so in this tract, which is entitled
<cite>The Usefulness of the Stage to the Happiness of Mankind, to
Government and to Religion</cite>, Dennis is uncompromisingly
ethical; but he had here the excuse that Collier, to whom
he was replying, had taken the same line. There is less, either
here or elsewhere, for his method. This is to make a loud
clatter of assertions, arranged in a kind of pseudological order,
which seems to have really deceived the author, and may
possibly have deceived some of his readers, into believing it
syllogistic and conclusive. Dennis is very great at the word
“must.” “As Poetry is an Art it <em>must</em> be an imitation of
nature”<a id='r565'></a><a href='#f565' class='c019'><sup>[565]</sup></a> and so forth; seldom shall you find so many “musts”
anywhere as in Dennis, save perhaps in some of his modern
analogues. Like all who argue in this fashion, he becomes
unable to distinguish fact and his own opinion. Collier, for
instance, had quoted (quite correctly) Seneca’s denunciation of
the Stage. To which Dennis replies, “It is not likely that
Seneca should condemn the drama, ... since ... he wrote
plays himself.” That the identity of the philosopher and the
dramatist is not certain does not matter: the characteristic
thing is the setting of probability against fact. But with
Dennis hectoring assertion is everything. “It cannot possibly
be conceived that so reasonable a diversion as the drama can
encourage or incline men to so unreasonable a one as gaming or
so brutal a one as drunkenness.” With a man who thinks this
an argument, argument is impossible.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fact is that, though he has, as has been admitted, a certain
advantage over Rymer, Lord Derby’s observation that “He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>never knew whether it was John or Thomas who answered
the bell” will too often apply here. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>On Shakespeare.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Rymer himself
was not ignorant; Dennis, especially in regard to
ancient criticism, was still better instructed: and though both
were bad dramatists, with, in consequence, a conscious or unconscious
bias on dramatic matters, Dennis was not so bad as
Rymer. His devotion to Dryden does him credit, though we
may suspect that it was not the best part of Dryden that he
liked: and, amid the almost frantic spite and scurrility of his
later attacks on Pope, he not unfrequently hits a weak place in
the “young squab short gentleman’s” bright but not invulnerable
armour. Yet Dennis displays, as no really good critic
could do, the weaknesses of his time and school both in generals
and particulars. It is perfectly fair to compare him (giving
weight for genius of course) with Johnson, a critic whose general
views (except on port and claret) did not materially differ from
his own. And, if we do so, we shall find that while Johnson is
generally, if not invariably, “too good for such a breed,” Dennis
almost as constantly shows its worst features. He altered <cite>The
Merry Wives of Windsor</cite> into <cite>The Comical Gallant</cite><a id='r566'></a><a href='#f566' class='c019'><sup>[566]</sup></a>—a most
illaudable action certainly, yet great Dryden’s self had done
such things before. But he aggravated the crime by a preface,
in which he finds fault with the original as having “no less than
three actions” [would there were thirty-three!] by remarking
that, in the second part of <cite>Henry the Fourth</cite>, Falstaff “does
nothing but talk” [would he had talked so for five hundred
acts instead of five!] and by laying down <span lang="la"><i>ex cathedra</i></span> such
generalities as that “Humour, not wit, is the business of
comedy,” a statement as false as would be its converse. In his
<cite>Essay on the Genius of Shakespeare</cite><a id='r567'></a><a href='#f567' class='c019'><sup>[567]</sup></a> he is not so very far
from Rymer himself in the drivelling arbitrariness of his
criticism. Shakespeare has actually made Aufidius, the general
of the Volscians, a base and profligate villain! Even Coriolanus
himself is allowed to be called a traitor by Aufidius, and nobody
contradicts! The rabble in <cite>Julius Cæsar</cite> and other such
things “show want of Art,” and there is a painful disregard of
Poetical Justice. The same hopeless wrong-headedness and (if

of this brilliantly artificial poem; but fewer would think of
objecting to it on Dennis’s grounds. Machines, it seems,
must be—</p>

<p class='c030'>And Pope’s machines, we are told, fail in all these respects.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, putting the fourth ground aside as being a mere matter
of opinion (and some who are not fervent Papists think the
machines of the <cite>Rape</cite> very prettily and cleverly arranged in
their puppet-show way), one may ask Dennis “Who on earth
told you so?” in respect of all the others. And if he alleged
(as he might) this or that sixteenth or seventeenth century
authority, “And who on earth told <em>him</em> so? and what authority
had the authority? Why should machines be taken only from
the religion of the country? Why should they be allegorical?
Why should Machine Dick on the one side invariably nod to
Machine Harry on the other?” And even if some sort of
answer be forthcoming, “Why should the poet not do as he
please if he succeeds thereby in giving the poetic pleasure?”
To which last query of course neither Dennis nor any of his
school could return any answer, except of the kind that requires
bell, book, and candle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor would he have hesitated to use this, for he is a rule-critic
of the very straitest kind, a “Tantivy” of poetic Divine
Right. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His general theory of Poetry.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In his three chief books of abstract criticism<a id='r569'></a><a href='#f569' class='c019'><sup>[569]</sup></a>
he endeavours to elaborate, with Longinus in part
for code, and with Milton for example, a noble,
indeed, and creditable, but utterly arbitrary and hopelessly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>narrow theory of poetry as <em>necessarily</em> religious, and as having
for its sole real end the reformation of the mind, by a sort of
enlarged Aristotelian <em>katharsis</em> as to spirit, and by attention
to the strict laws of the art in form. Poetical Justice was a
sort of mediate divinity to Dennis: as we have seen, he upbraided
Shakespeare for the want of it; he remonstrated, in
the <cite>Spectator</cite>, No. 548, and elsewhere, with Addison for taking
too little account of it; part at least of his enthusiasm for
Milton comes from Milton’s avowed intention to make his
poem a theodicy.</p>

<p class='c000'>A noble error! let it be repeated, with no hint or shadow of
sarcasm or of irreverence; but a fatal error as well. That
Poetry, like all things human, lives and moves and has its
being in God, the present writer believes as fervently and
unhesitatingly as any Platonic philosopher or any Patristic
theologian; and he would cheerfully incur the wrath of
Savonarola by applying the epithet “divine,” in its fullest
meaning, not merely to tragedy and epic and hymn, but to
song of wine and of love. But this is not what Dennis meant
at all. He meant that Poetry is to have a definitely religious,
definitely moral <em>purpose</em>—not that it is and tends of itself
necessarily <span lang="la"><i>ad majorem Dei gloriam</i></span>, but that we are to shape
it according to what our theological and ethical ideas of the
glory of God are. This way easily comes bad poetry, not at all
easily good; and it excludes poetic varieties which may be as
good as the best written in obedience to it, and better. Moreover,
putting Dennis’s notion of the end of Poetry together with
his notion of its method or art (which latter is to be adjusted
to some at least of the straitest classical precepts), we can easily
comprehend, and could easily have anticipated, the narrow intolerance
and the hectoring pedantry which he shows towards
all who follow not him. In a new sense—not so very different
from the old mediæval one, though put with no mediæval
glamour, and by an exponent full of eighteenth-century prosaism,
yet destitute of eighteenth-century neatness and concinnity—Poetry
becomes a part of theology; and the mere
irritableness of the man of letters is aggravated into the <span lang="la"><i>odium
theologicum</i></span>. Bad poets (that is to say, bad according to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>Dennis) are not merely faulty artists but wicked men; of this
Dennis is sure. “And when a man is sure,” as he himself
somewhere naïvely observes, “’tis his duty to speak with a
modest assurance.” We know, from examples more recent
than poor Dennis, that, when a man is thus minded, his assurance
is very apt to eat up his modesty, taking his charity,
his good manners, and some other things, as condiments to the
meal.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dennis and Addison, though the latter did not escape the
absolute impartiality of the former’s carping, were on terms of
mutual respect which, considering all things, were
creditable to both. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Addison.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> During the latter part of his
rather short lifetime Addison, it is hardly necessary to say,
enjoyed a sort of mild dictatorship in Criticism as in other
departments of literature; and his right to it was scarcely
disputed till near the close of the century, though Johnson
knew that he was not deep, and tells us that, in his own last
days, it was almost a fashion to look down on Addisonian
criticism. If, like others, he was displaced by the Romantic
revival, he received more lenient treatment than some, in virtue
partly of his own general moderation, partly of his championship
of Milton. Yet while his original literary gifts recovered high
place during the nineteenth century, his criticism has often
been considered to possess scarcely more than historic interest,
and has sometimes been rather roughly handled—for instance,
by Mr Matthew Arnold. But a recent writer,<a id='r570'></a><a href='#f570' class='c019'><sup>[570]</sup></a> by arguing that
Addison’s treatment of the Imagination, as a separate faculty,
introduced a new principle into criticism, has at any rate
claimed for him a position which, if it could be granted,
would seat him among the very greatest masters of the art,
with Aristotle and Longinus among his own forerunners. As
usual let us, before discussing these various estimates, see what
Addison actually did as a critic.<a id='r571'></a><a href='#f571' class='c019'><sup>[571]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>His <span lang="fr"><i>début</i></span> as such was not fortunate. He was, it is true, only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>three-and-twenty when at “dearest Harry’s” request (that is to
say Mr Harry Sacheverell’s) he undertook an <cite>Account
of the greatest English Poets</cite>.<a id='r572'></a><a href='#f572' class='c019'><sup>[572]</sup></a> <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Account of the Best known English Poets.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In 1694 nobody, except
Dryden, could be expected to write very good
verse, so that the poetical qualities of this verse-essay
need not be hardly dwelt upon, or indeed considered
at all. We may take it, as if it were prose, for the matter
only. And thus considered, it must surely be thought one of
the worst examples of the pert and tasteless ignorance of its
school. Before Cowley nobody but Chaucer and Spenser is
mentioned at all, and the mentions of these are simply grotesque.
The lines convict Addison, almost beyond appeal, of being at the
time utterly ignorant of English literary history up to 1600, and
of having read Chaucer and Spenser themselves, if he had read
them at all, with his eyes shut. The Chaucer section reads as
if it were describing <cite>A C. Merry Tales</cite> or the <cite>Jests of George
Peele</cite>. Where Dryden, if he did not understand Chaucer’s
versification, and missed some of his poetry, could see much even
of that, and almost all the humour, the grace, the sweetness, the
“God’s plenty” of life and character that Chaucer has, Addison
sees nothing but a merry-andrew of the day before yesterday.<a id='r573'></a><a href='#f573' class='c019'><sup>[573]</sup></a>
So, too, the consummate art of Spenser, his exquisite versification,
his great ethical purpose, and yet his voluptuous beauty,
are quite hidden from Addison. He sees nothing but a tedious
allegory of improbable adventures, and objects to the “dull
moral” which “lies too plain below,” much as Temple had
done before him.<a id='r574'></a><a href='#f574' class='c019'><sup>[574]</sup></a> Cowley, Milton, and Waller are mentioned
next, in at least asserted chronological order. Cowley is “a
mighty genius” full of beauties and faults,</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Who more had pleased us had he pleased us less,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>but who is a perfect “milky way” of brilliancy, and has made
Pindar himself “take a nobler flight.” Milton alternately strikes
Addison with awe, rapture, and shock at his politics. He</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Betrays a bottom odious to the sight.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>So we turn to Waller, who is not only “courtly” but “moves
our passion,” (what a pity that he died too soon to "rehearse
Maria’s charms"!) to Roscommon, who “makes even rules a
noble poetry,” and Denham, whose Cooper’s Hill “we must,”
of course, not “forget.” “Great Dryden” is then, not unhappily,
though not quite adequately, celebrated, and the line
on his Muse—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“She wears all dresses, and she charms in all,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>is not only neat, but very largely true. When Dryden shall
decay, luckily there is harmonious Congreve: and, if Addison
were not tired with rhyming, he would praise (he does so at
some length) noble Montague, who directs his artful muse to
Dorset,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“In numbers such as Dorset’s self might use,”—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>as to which all that can be said is that, if so, either the verses
of Montague or the verses of Dorset referred to are not those
that have come down to us under the names of the respective
authors.</p>

<p class='c000'>To dwell at all severely on this luckless production of a
young University wit would be not only unkind but uncritical.
It shows that at this time Addison knew next to nothing<a id='r575'></a><a href='#f575' class='c019'><sup>[575]</sup></a>
about the English literature not of his own day, and judged
very badly of what he pretended to know.</p>

<p class='c000'>The prose works of his middle period, the <cite>Discourse on
Medals</cite> and the <cite>Remarks on Italy</cite>, are very fully illustrated
from the Latin poets—the division of literature that Addison
knew best—but indulge hardly at all in literary criticism. It
was not till the launching of the <cite>Tatler</cite>, by Steele and Swift,
provided him with his natural medium of utterance, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>Addison became critical. This periodical itself, and the less
known ones that followed the <cite>Spectator</cite>, all contain exercises in
this character: but it is to the <cite>Spectator</cite> that men look, and
look rightly, for Addison’s credentials in the character of a
critic. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Spectator <i>criticisms</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The <cite>Tatler</cite> Essays, such as the rather well known papers
on Tom Folio and Ned Softly, those in the <cite>Guardian</cite>, the good-natured
puff of Tom D’Urfey, &#38;c., are not so much
serious and deliberate literary criticisms, as applications,
to subjects more or less literary, of the
peculiar method of gently malicious censorship, of laughing
castigation in manners and morals, which Addison carried to
such perfection in all the middle relations of life. Not only
are the <cite>Spectator</cite> articles far more numerous and far more
weighty, but we have his own authority for regarding them as,
in some measure at least, written on a deliberate system, and
divisible into three groups. The first of these groups consists
of the early papers on True and False Wit, and of essays on
the stage. The second contains the famous and elaborate criticism
of Milton with other things; and the third, the still later,
still more serious, and still more ambitious, series on the
Pleasures of the Imagination. Addison is looking back from
the beginning of this last when he gives the general description,<a id='r576'></a><a href='#f576' class='c019'><sup>[576]</sup></a>
and it is quite possible that the complete trilogy was
not in his mind when he began the first group. But there is
regular development in it, and whether we agree or not with
Mr Worsfold’s extremely high estimate of the third division,
it is quite certain that the whole collection—of some thirty
or forty essays—does clearly exhibit that increasing sense of
what criticism means, which is to be observed in almost all
good critics. For criticism is, on the one hand, an art in
which there are so few manuals or trustworthy short summaries—it
is one which depends so much more on reading and knowledge
than any creative art—and, above all, it is necessary to
make so many mistakes in it before one comes right, that,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>probably, not one single example can be found of a critic of
importance who was not a much better critic when he left off
than when he began.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Group One<a id='r577'></a><a href='#f577' class='c019'><sup>[577]</sup></a> Addison is still animated by the slightly
desultory spirit of moral satire, which has been referred to
above; and, though fifteen or sixteen years have
passed since the <cite>Account</cite>, he does not seem to be
so entirely free as we might wish from the crude sciolism,
if not the sheer ignorance, of the earliest period. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>On True and False Wit.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He is
often admirable: his own humour, his taste, almost perfect
within its own narrow limits, and his good sense, made that
certain beforehand. But he has rather overloaded it with
somewhat artificial allegory, the ethical temper rather overpowers
the literary, and there is not a little of that arbitrary
“blackmarking” of certain literary things which is one of the
worst faults of neo-classic criticism. The Temple of Dulness
is built (of course) “after the Gothic manner,” and the image of
the god is dressed “after the habit of a monk.” Among the
idolatrous rites and implements are not merely rebuses, anagrams,
verses arranged in artificial forms, and other things a
little childish, though perfectly harmless, but acrostics—trifles,
perhaps, yet trifles which can be made exquisitely graceful,
and satisfying that desire for mixing passion with playfulness
which is not the worst affection of the human heart.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had led up to this batch, a few weeks earlier, by some
cursory remarks on Comedy, which form the tail of a more
elaborate examination of Tragedy, filling four or five
numbers.<a id='r578'></a><a href='#f578' class='c019'><sup>[578]</sup></a> <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>On Tragedy.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Readers who have already mastered the
general drift of the criticism of the time before him, will
scarcely need any long <span lang="fr"><i>précis</i></span> of his views, which, moreover, are
in everybody’s reach, and could not possibly be put more
readably. Modern tragedies, he thinks, excel those of Greece
and Rome in the intricacy and disposition of the fable, but
fall short in the moral. He objects to rhyme (except an end-couplet
or two), and, though he thinks the style of our tragedies
superior to the sentiment, finds the former, especially in
Shakespeare, defaced by “sounding phrases, hard metaphors,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>and forced expressions.” This is still more the case in Lee.
Otway is very “tender”: but it is a sad thing that the
characters in <cite>Venice Preserved</cite> should be traitors and rebels.
Poetic justice (this was what shocked Dennis), as generally
understood, is rather absurd, and quite unnecessary. And the
tragi-comedy, which is the product of the English theatre, is
“one of the most monstrous inventions that ever entered into a
poet’s thought.” You “might as well weave the adventures of
Æneas and Hudibras into one poem” [and, indeed, one might
find some relief in this, as far as the adventures of Æneas are
concerned]. Tragedies are not even to have a double plot.
Rants, and especially impious rants, are bad. Darkened stages,
elaborate scenery and dresses, troops of supers, &#38;c., are as bad:
bells, ghosts, thunder, and lightning still worse. “Of all our
methods of moving pity and terror, there is none so absurd and
barbarous as the dreadful butchering of one another,” though
all deaths on the stage are not to be forbidden.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, it is not difficult to characterise the criticism which
appears in this first group, strengthened, if anybody cares, by a
few isolated examples. It contains a great deal of common
sense and good ordinary taste; many of the things that it
reprehends are really wrong, and most of what it praises is
good in a way. But the critic has as yet no guiding theory,
except what he thinks he has gathered from Aristotle, and has
certainly gathered from Horace, <em>plus</em> Common Sense itself,
with, as is the case with all English critics of this age, a good
deal from his French predecessors, especially Le Bossu and
Bouhours. Which borrowing, while it leads him into numerous
minor errors, leads him into two great ones—his denunciations
of tragi-comedy, and of the double plot. He is, moreover,
essentially arbitrary: his criticism will seldom stand the application
of the “Why?” the “<span lang="fr"><i>Après?</i></span>” and a harsh judge might,
in some places, say that it is not more arbitrary than ignorant.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Second Group,<a id='r579'></a><a href='#f579' class='c019'><sup>[579]</sup></a> or Miltonic batch, with which may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>taken its “moon,” the partly playful but more largely serious
<span lang="la"><i>examen</i></span> of <cite>Chevy Chase</cite>, is much the best known, and
has been generally ranked as the most important
exhibition of Addison’s critical powers. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>On Milton.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It is not, however, out
of paradox or desire to be singular that it will be somewhat
briefly discussed here. By the student of Addison it cannot be
too carefully studied; for the historian of criticism it has indeed
high importance, but importance which can be very briefly
summed up, and which requires no extensive analysis of the
eighteen distinct essays that compose the Miltonic group, or
the two on <cite>Chevy Chase</cite>. The critic here takes for granted—and
knows or assumes that his readers will grant—two general
positions:—</p>

<p class='c000'>1. The Aristotelian-Horatian view of poetry, with a few of
the more commonplace utterances of Longinus, supplies the
orthodox theory of Poetics.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. The ancients, especially Homer and Virgil, supply the most
perfect examples of the orthodox practice of poetry.</p>

<p class='c000'>These things posed, he proceeds to examine <cite>Chevy Chase</cite> at
some, <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> at great, length by their aid; and discovers
in the ballad not a few, and in the epic very great and
very numerous, excellences. As Homer does this, so Milton
does that: such a passage in Virgil is a more or less exact
analogue to such another in <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>. Aristotle says this,
Horace that, Longinus the third thing; and you will find the
dicta capitally exemplified in such and such a place of Milton’s
works. To men who accepted the principle—as most, if not all,
men did—the demonstration was no doubt both interesting and
satisfactory; and though it certainly did not start general admiration
of Milton, it stamped that admiration with a comfortable
seal of official orthodoxy. But it is actually more antiquated
than Dryden, in assuming that the question whether
Milton wrote according to Aristotle is coextensive with the
question whether he wrote good poetry.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next batch is far more important.</p>

<p class='c000'>What <em>are</em> the Pleasures of the Imagination? It is of the
first moment to observe Addison’s exact definition.<a id='r580'></a><a href='#f580' class='c019'><sup>[580]</sup></a> <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The “Pleasures of the Imagination.”</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Sight is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>the “sense which furnishes the imagination with its ideas; so
that by the ‘Pleasures of the Imagination’ or
Fancy, which I shall use promiscuously, I here
mean such as arise from visible objects, either when
we have them actually in our view, or when we call
up their ideas into our minds by paintings, statues, descriptions,
or any the like occasion.” We can have no images not thus
furnished, though they may be altered and compounded by
imagination itself. To make this quite sure, he repeats that he
means <em>only</em> such pleasures as thus arise. He then proceeds, at
some length, to argue for the innocence and refinement of such
pleasures, their usefulness, and so on; and further, to discuss
the causes or origins of pleasure in sight, which he finds to be
three—greatness, uncommonness, and beauty. The pleasantness
of these is assigned to such and such wise and good
purposes of the Creator, with a reference to the great modern
discoveries of Mr Locke’s essay.</p>

<p class='c000'>Addison then goes on to consider the sources of entertainment
to the imagination, and decides that, for the purpose, art
is very inferior to nature, though both rise in value as each
borrows from the other. He adduces, in illustration, an odd
rococo mixture of scene-painting and reflection of actual objects
which he once saw (p. 404). Italian and French gardens are
next praised, in opposition to the old formal English style, and
naturally trained trees to the productions of the <span lang="la"><i>ars topiaria</i></span>;
while a very long digression is made to greatness in Architecture,
illustrated by this remark (p. 409), “Let any one reflect on
the disposition of mind in which he finds himself at his first
entrance into the Pantheon at Rome, ... and consider how
little in proportion he is affected with the inside of a Gothic
cathedral, though it be five times larger than the other,” the
reason being “the greatness of the manner in the one, and the
meanness in the other.”</p>

<p class='c000'>So the “secondary” pleasures of the imagination—<i>i.e.</i>, those
compounded and manufactured by memory—are illustrated by
the arts of sculpture and painting, with a good passage on
description generally, whence he turns to the Cartesian doctrine
of the association of ideas, and shows very ingeniously how the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>poet may avail himself of this. Next comes a curious and often
just analysis of the reasons of pleasure in description—how, for
instance, he likes Milton’s Paradise better than his Hell, because
brimstone and sulphur are not so refreshing to the
imagination as beds of flowers and wildernesses of sweets.
Or we may like things because they “raise a secret ferment
in the mind,” either directly, or so as to arouse a feeling of relief
by comparison, as when we read of tortures, wounds, and deaths.
Moreover, the poet may improve Nature. Let oranges grow
wild, and roses, woodbines, and jessamines flower at the same
time. As for “the fairy way of writing”<a id='r581'></a><a href='#f581' class='c019'><sup>[581]</sup></a>—that is to say, the
supernatural—it requires a very odd turn of mind. We do it
better than most other nations, because of our gloominess and
melancholy of temper. Shakespeare excels everybody else in
touching “this weak superstitious part” of his reader’s imagination.
The glorifying of the imagination, however, is by no means
confined to the poet. In good historians we “see” everything.
None more gratify the imagination than the authors of the
new philosophy, astronomers, microscopists. This (No. 420) is
one of Addison’s most ambitious passages of writing, and the
whole ends (421) with a peroration excellently hit off.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is upon these papers mainly that Mr Worsfold<a id='r582'></a><a href='#f582' class='c019'><sup>[582]</sup></a> bases
his high eulogium of Addison as “the first genuine critic,” the
first “who added something to the last word of Hellenism,”
the bringer of criticism “into line with modern thought,” the
establisher of “a new principle of poetic appeal.” Let us, as
uncontroversially as possible, and without laying any undue
stress on the fact that Mr Worsfold practically omits Longinus
altogether,<a id='r583'></a><a href='#f583' class='c019'><sup>[583]</sup></a> stick, in our humdrum way, to the facts.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the first place, supposing for the moment that Addison
uses “imagination” in our full modern sense, and supposing,
secondly, for the moment also, that he assigns the appeal to the
imagination as the special engine of the poet, is this an original
discovery of his? By no means: there are many <span lang="la"><i>loci</i></span> of former
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>writers to negative this—there is one that is fatal. And this
is no more recondite a thing than the famous Shakespearian
description of</p>

      <div class='line'>“Of <em>imagination</em> all compact,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>with what follows. But this is a mere question of property,
plagiarism, suggestion; and such questions are at best the exercises
of literary holiday-makers, at the worst the business of
pedants and of fools.</p>

<p class='c000'>A more important as well as a more dangerous question is
this. <em>Does</em> Addison make “the appeal to the imagination” the
test of poetry? It can only be answered that, by his own
explicit words, he does nothing of the kind. If he advances
anything, it is that the appeal to the imagination is the appeal
of art generally—of prose (even of scientific) literary art as well
as of poetry, of painting, sculpture, architecture, as well as of
literature. In doing this he does a good thing: he does something
notable in the history of general æsthetics; but in so far
as literature, and especially poetry, is concerned, he scarcely
goes as far as Longinus in the well-known passage,<a id='r584'></a><a href='#f584' class='c019'><sup>[584]</sup></a> though he
works out his doctrine at much greater length, and with assistance
from Descartes and Locke.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the most important and the most damaging question of
all is this, “Are not Addison and his panegyrist using words in
equivocal senses? <em>Does</em> Imagination in Addison’s mouth bear
the meaning which we, chiefly since Coleridge’s day, attach to
the word? Does it even mean what it meant to Longinus,
much more what it meant to Shakespeare?”</p>

<p class='c000'>I have no hesitation in answering the two latter questions
with an absolute and unhesitating “No!”</p>

<p class='c000'>It seems indeed extraordinary that, in face of Addison’s
most careful and explicit limitations, any one should delude
himself into thinking that even the Shakespearian and Addisonian
Imaginations are identical—much more that Addison’s
Imagination is the supreme faculty, creative, transcending
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>Fancy,<a id='r585'></a><a href='#f585' class='c019'><sup>[585]</sup></a> superior to fact, not merely compounding and refining
upon, but altogether superseding and almost scorning, ideas of
sensation, which we mean by the word, and which Philostratus
or Apollonius<a id='r586'></a><a href='#f586' class='c019'><sup>[586]</sup></a> partly glimpsed. Addison tells us—tells us over
and over again—that <em>all</em> the ideas and pleasures of the imagination
are pleasures of sense, and, what is more, that they are all
pleasures of one sense—Sight. Why he should have limited
himself in this singular manner it is hard to say; except that
he was evidently full of Locke when he wrote, and, indeed,
almost entirely under the influence of the <cite>Essay</cite>. That he had
a contempt for music is elsewhere pretty evident; and this
probably explains his otherwise inexplicable omission of the
supplies and assistance given to Imagination by Hearing. His
morality, as well as old convention, excluded Touch, Taste, and
Smell as low and gross, though no candid philosophy could help
acknowledging the immense influence exercised upon Imagination
by at least the first and the last—Taste, because the most
definite, being perhaps the least imaginative of all. But the
fact that he does exclude even these senses, and still more
rigidly excludes everything but Sense, is insuperable, irremovable,
ruthless. Addison may have been the first modern critic
to work out the appeal of art to the pleasures and ideas furnished
by the sense of sight. He is certainly nothing more.</p>

<p class='c000'>But is he therefore to be ignored, or treated lightly, because
of this strange overvaluation of him?  Certainly not. <span class='sni side12'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His general critical value.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Though
by no means a very great critic, he is a useful, an
interesting, and a representative one. He represents
the classical attitude tempered, not merely by good
sense almost in quintessence, but by a large share of tolerance
and positive good taste, by freedom from the more utterly
ridiculous pseudo-Aristotelianisms, and by a wish to extend a
<span lang="fr"><i>concordat</i></span> to everything good even if it be not “faultless.” In
his <cite>Account</cite> he is evidently too crude to be very censurable: in
his first group of essays much of his censure is just. The
elaborate vindication of Milton, though now and for a long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>time past merely a curiosity, is again full of good sense, displays
(if not altogether according to knowledge) a real liking
for real poetic goodness, and had an inestimable effect in keeping
at least one poet of the better time privileged and popular
with readers throughout the Eighteenth Century. As for the
essay on the Pleasures of the Imagination, the fact that it has
been wrongly praised need not in the least interfere with a
cordial estimate of its real merits. It is not an epoch-making
contribution to literary criticism; it is rather one-sided, and
strangely limited in range. But it is about the first attempt
at a general theory of æsthetics in English; it is a most interesting,
and a very early, example of that application of
common-sense philosophy to abstract subjects which Locke
taught to the English eighteenth century; and many of its
remarks are valuable and correct. Moreover, it did actually
serve, for those who could not, or who did not, read Longinus,
as a corrective to pure form-criticism, to Bysshe with his rigid
ten syllables, to bare good sense and conventional rule. Its
Imagination was still only that which supplies Images, and was
strangely cramped besides; but it was better than mere correctness,
mere decency, mere stop-watch.</p>

<p class='c000'>Between Addison and Pope, Steele, Atterbury, and Swift
call for notice. <span class='sni side4'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Steele.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Steele has little for us.<a id='r587'></a><a href='#f587' class='c019'><sup>[587]</sup></a> There are few things
more curious than the almost entire abstinence from
any expression, in the slightest degree really critical,
to be found in the eulogy of Spenser, which he generously enough
inserted in <cite>Sp.</cite> 540 to express “his passion for that charming
author.” The numerous friends whom he has so justly won for
himself may perhaps insist that there is criticism of the best in
this very phrase; and that the rather rash encomium on the
poet’s “old words” as being “all truly English” is balanced by
the justice of the reference to his “exquisite numbers.” But the
fact is that Steele had neither the knowledge, nor the patience,
nor the coolness for critical work.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>Atterbury gives rather more.  He was himself a man of
great intellectual power, a scholar, an eloquent and delicate
writer, and possessed independent taste enough to
admire Milton fervently at a time when Addison
had not yet made it wholly orthodox to admire that poet at all,
and when most Tories detested him. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Atterbury.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But his observations on
Waller<a id='r588'></a><a href='#f588' class='c019'><sup>[588]</sup></a> are the very quintessence of pseudodoxy, as to that respectable
person; and, by a curious combination, though Waller
is a rhymer confirmed and complete, Atterbury joins with his
admiration for him an antipathy to rhyme—“this jingling
kind of poetry,” “this troublesome bondage, as Mr Milton well
calls it.” As for this we need say little; the danger lay not
there. But it lay in the direction of such remarks as that
“English came into Waller’s hands like a rough diamond; he
polished it first,” that, “for aught I know, he stands last as well
as first in the list of refiners” [imagine the excellent Waller as
be-all and end-all of English!], that “verse before Waller was
downright prose tagged with rhyme,” &#38;c., &#38;c. Once more let
our impatience of this talk not be ignorant—as is the impatience
of those who nowadays cannot see music in Dryden, poetry
in Pope, “cry” and clangour now and then even in persons
like Langhorne and Mickle. He expressed an opinion; but in
expressing it he showed this same ignorance from which we
should abstain. Instead of pointing out that Waller introduced
a <em>different</em> kind of music, he insisted that Waller substituted
music for discord: instead of saying that he introduced a
new fashion of cutting the diamond, he would have it that the
diamond was merely rough before. This was the <span lang="la"><i>culpa</i></span>, the
<span lang="la"><i>maxima culpa</i></span> of eighteenth-century criticism, and Atterbury
illustrates and shares it.<a id='r589'></a><a href='#f589' class='c019'><sup>[589]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The critical work of Swift<a id='r590'></a><a href='#f590' class='c019'><sup>[590]</sup></a> is much more important, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>though a good deal of it is inextricably mixed up with the
work of Pope and of Arbuthnot, the lion’s claw is
generally perceptible enough. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Swift.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The famous <cite>Tatler</cite>
of September 28, 1710, on the conceptions of English style and
writing, ought to hold place in every history and course of
lectures on the subject, next to Sprat’s passage in the <cite>History
of the Royal Society</cite> forty years before, as the manifesto of
a fresh stage in English style-criticism; and it practically
precedes everything that Addison, Steele, and Pope published
on, or in connection with, the subject. But long before this,
in the wonderful volume which first (1704) revealed his genius
to the world, Swift had shown how critical the Gods had made
him.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>The Battle of the Books</cite> is one of the most eccentric documents
in the whole History of our subject. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Battle of the Books.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Directly, and on
its face, it may be said to be of the first critical importance;
because it shows how very little subject,
intention, accuracy to fact, verisimilitude, and half-a-dozen
other indispensables according to certain theories, have
to do with the goodness of a book. The general characteristics
of <cite>The Battle of the Books</cite> in all these named respects, and some
of the unnamed ones, are deplorable. In a tedious and idle
quarrel which, at least as it was actually debated, never need
have been debated at all, Swift takes the side which, if not the
intrinsically wrong one, is the wrong one as he takes it. To
represent Bentley, or even Wotton, as enemies of the Ancients
might seem preposterous, if it were not outdone by the preposterousness
of selecting Temple as their champion. The details
are often absurd—from that ranking of “<span lang="es">Despréaux</span>” side
by side with Cowley as a Modern brigadier, which is probably
a slip (perhaps for “Desportes”) of pen or press, to the spiteful
injustices on Dryden. The idea of the piece was probably taken
from Callières.<a id='r591'></a><a href='#f591' class='c019'><sup>[591]</sup></a> Its composition, from the rigid “Ancient”
point of view, is sadly lax; and the two most brilliant episodes—the
“Sweetness and Light” quarrel of the Spider and the Bee,
and the “machine” of the Goddess of Criticism—have little or
nothing to do with the action. But yet it is—and one knows
it is—a masterpiece; and it is pretty certain from it that in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>certain kinds of destructive criticism, and even in certain kinds
of what may be called destructive-constructive, the author will
be able to accomplish almost anything that he is likely to try.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though the <cite>Tale of the Tub</cite> is less ostensibly bookish, it shows
even greater purely critical power: for the power of the <cite>Battle</cite>
is mainly that of a consummate craftsman, who can
accomplish by sheer craftsmanship whatsoever his
hand findeth to do. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Tale of a Tub.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>In the <cite>Tale</cite> the crusade against bad
writing and bad writers, which Swift carried on more or less for
the whole of his middle and later years, and in which he enlisted
Addison and Pope, Arbuthnot and Gay, is all but formally proclaimed,
and is most vigorously waged with or without proclamation.
In the “Dedication to Somers” the sword is being
something more than loosened in the sheath; it flashes out in
“The Bookseller to the Reader”; it is doing sanguinary work in
the great “Epistle to Prince Posterity;” and it has only momentary
rests in the “Preface” and the “Induction”: while there
is hardly a section of the main text in which the quarters of
Grub Street are not beaten up, and the Conclusion is even as
the preludes and the main body.</p>

<p class='c000'>A shrewd judge could hardly fail to perceive, from these
famous twin-books, that a new genius of thoroughly critical
character had arisen: but such a judge might well
have doubted how far its exercise could be anything
but negative. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Minor works.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> His doubts, as we have already hinted, were
to be justified. Indirectly, indeed, not merely in the <cite>Tatler</cite>
paper above referred to and elsewhere, but by that almost uncanny
influence which he seems to have exerted in so many
ways on men only less than himself, Swift had very much to
do with the rescuing of Style, by the hands of Addison and the
rest, from the vulgarisation which it was undergoing at the
close of the seventeenth century, not merely in common writers,
not merely in the hands of an eccentric like L’Estrange, but in
those of scholars like Collier and Bentley. But even this was
a task of destruction rather than of positive construction, and
he was always most at home in such tasks. The <cite>Meditation on
a Broomstick</cite> and the <cite>Tritical Essay</cite>, though every good reviewer
should know them by heart, and will have but too many
opportunities of using his knowledge, are delivered with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>backward, not the forward, speech of the critic; the <cite>Proposal
for correcting the English Tongue</cite>, which falls in with the <cite>Tatler</cite>
paper, aims at a sort of stationary state of language and literature
alike, at proscriptions and ostracisings; the <cite>Letter to a
Young Clergyman</cite> and the <cite>Essay on Modern Education</cite>, though
both touch on literature, are exceedingly general in their
precepts; and though all persons with a true English appreciation
of shameless puns and utter nonsense must delight in
<cite>The Antiquity of the English Tongue</cite>, it cannot be called serious
criticism. There is more in the <cite>Advice to a Young Poet</cite>: but
even here Swift is rather “running humours” on his subject
than discussing it in the grave and chaste manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>We shall therefore hardly be wrong if, after excepting the
literary directions of the universal satiric <span lang="fr"><i>douche</i></span> in the <cite>Tale of
a Tub</cite>, and the useful but somewhat rudimentary warnings of
the <cite>Tatler</cite> paper, we see the most characteristic critical work of
Swift in <cite>Martinus Scriblerus</cite> and the <cite>Peri Bathous</cite>, especially
in the latter, which, though it be principally attributed to
Arbuthnot and Pope, is as surely Swiftian in suggestion as if
the Dean had written and published it alone. Often as it has
been imitated, and largely as its methods have been drawn
upon, it has never been surpassed as an Art of General and
Particular “Slating”: and the sections on the Figures, with the
immortal receipt for making an epic poem (the full beauty of
which is lost on those who do not know how appallingly close
it is to the approved prescriptions of the best neo-classic critics),
cannot be too highly praised. But, once more, the critic is here
at hangman’s work only: he allows himself neither to admire
nor to love.</p>

<p class='c000'>These principles, put in various ways by writers of more or
less genius for half a century, found what seemed to more than
two generations (always with a few dissidents) something
like consummate expression in certain well-known
utterances of Pope. <span class='sni side4'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Pope.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> As expression these utterances
may still receive a very high degree of admiration: as anything
else it is difficult to believe that any turn of fashion, unless it
brings with it oblivion for large districts of noble literature, can
restore them to much authority. Pope, though better read than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>he seems in his poems, was by no means a learned man; and it
is now pretty generally admitted that his intellect was acute
rather than powerful. The obstinate superficiality—the reduction
of everything, even the most recondite problems of
philosophy, even the most far-ranging questions of erudition,
to a jury of “common-sense” persons, decorated with a little of
the fashion of the town—which had set in, found in him an
exponent as competent to give it exquisite expression as he was
indisposed, and probably incompetent, to deepen or extend its
scope. He attained early to nearly his full powers, and it does
not much matter whether the <cite>Essay on Criticism</cite> was written at
the age of twenty or at that of twenty-two. He could have
improved it a little in form, but would hardly have altered it at
all in matter, if he had written it thirty years later. The
<cite>Imitation of the Epistle of Horace to Augustus</cite>, which was
actually written about that time, is, though superior as verse,
almost inferior as criticism, and more “out” in fact. The two
together give a sufficient view of Pope as he wished to be taken
critically. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Letters.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But to be perfectly fair we must add the
critical utterances in his <cite>Letters</cite>,<a id='r592'></a><a href='#f592' class='c019'><sup>[592]</sup></a> his Preface to
Shakespeare, and (with caution of course) the remarks attributed
to him by Spence. The Preface has received much praise; and
has deserved some even from those who follow not Pope generally.
It would be unfair to blame him for adopting the mixed
“beauty and fault” system which had the patronage of great
names in antiquity, and found hardly even questioners in his
own time. And it is something that he recognises Shakespeare’s
power over the passions, the individuality of his
characters, his intuitive knowledge of the world and of nature.
He is moderate and sensible on the relations of Shakespeare
and Jonson; he has practically said all that is to be said, in an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>endless and tiresome controversy, by writing, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Shakespeare Preface.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “To judge Shakespeare
by Aristotle’s rules is like trying a man by
the laws of one country who acted under those of
another.” And for such utterances we may excuse,
or at least pass over with little or no comment, the remarks that
Shakespeare kept bad company, that he wrote to please the
populace, that he resembles “an ancient majestic piece of Gothic
architecture [so far, so good], where many of the details are
childish, ill-placed, and unequal to its grandeur.” The littleness
of this patchy, yea-nay criticism beside the great and everlasting
appreciation of his master Dryden speaks for itself; it
is only fair to remember that the very existence of Dryden’s for
once really marmoreal inscription almost inevitably belittled and
hampered Pope. He was obliged to be different; and internal
as well as external influences made it certain that if he were
different he would be less.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <cite>Popiana</cite> of Spence<a id='r593'></a><a href='#f593' class='c019'><sup>[593]</sup></a> add more to our idea of Pope’s
critical faculty, or at least of its exercises; in fact, it is possible
to take a much better estimate of Pope’s “literature”
from the <cite>Anecdotes</cite> than from the <cite>Works</cite>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Spence’s</i> Anecdotes.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Although the Boswellian spirit was, fortunately enough for
posterity, very strong in the eighteenth century, there was no
particular reason why Spence should toady Pope—especially
as he published nothing to obtain pence or popularity from
the toadying. That rather remarkable collection, or re-collection,
of Italian-Latin poetry of the Renaissance,<a id='r594'></a><a href='#f594' class='c019'><sup>[594]</sup></a> of which not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>much notice has been taken by Pope’s biographers, would, of
itself, show critical interest in a part, and no unnoteworthy
part, of literature: and a few of the Spencean salvages bear
directly upon this. He need not have been ashamed of his
special liking for Politian’s <cite>Ambra</cite>: and he was right in thinking
Bembo “stiff and unpoetical,” though hardly in joining
Sadolet with him in this condemnation. We know perfectly
well why he did not like Rabelais, for which Swift very
properly scolded him: indeed, he tells us himself, twice over,
that “there were so many things” in Master Francis, “in
which he could not see any manner of meaning driven at,”
that he could not read him with any patience. This is really
more tale-telling than the constantly quoted passage about
Walsh and correctness. For, after all, everybody aspires to be
correct: only everybody has his own notions of what is correctness.
It is not everybody—and, as we see, it was not the
great Mr Pope—who could, or can, appreciate nonsense, and
see how much more sensible than sense the best of it is. It
would skill but little to go through his isolated judgments: but
there are one or two which are eloquent.</p>

<p class='c000'>Still, it is to the <cite>Essay</cite> and the <cite>Epistle</cite> that we must turn for
his deliberate theory of criticism, announced in youth, indorsed
and emphasised in age. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Essay on Criticism.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> And we meet at once with
a difficulty. The possessor of such a theory ought,
at least, to have something like a connected knowledge, at least
a connected view, of literature as a whole, and to be able to
square the two. All Pope seems to have done is to take the
<cite>Arts</cite> of Horace, Vida, and Boileau, to adopt as many of their
principles as he understood, and as would go into his sharp
antithetic couplet, to drag their historical illustrations head and
shoulders into his scheme without caring for the facts, and to
fill in and embroider with criticisms, observations, and precepts,
sometimes very shrewd, almost always perfectly expressed, but
far too often arbitrary, conventional, and limited. He is
most unfortunate of all in the historical part, where Boileau
had been sufficiently unfortunate before him. The Frenchman’s
observations on Villon and Ronsard had been ignorant
enough, and forced enough: but Pope managed to go a little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>beyond them in the <cite>Essay</cite>, and a great distance further still in
the <cite>Epistle</cite>. The history of the famous passage,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“We conquered France, but felt our captive’s charms,”<a id='r595'></a><a href='#f595' class='c019'><sup>[595]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>is like nothing on earth but the history-poetry of the despised
monkish ages, in which Alexander has twelve peers, and
Arthur, early in the sixth century, overruns Europe with a
British force, and fights with a Roman Emperor named Lucius.
And the sketch of European literature in the <cite>Essay</cite>, if it
contains no single statement so glaringly absurd, is as much a
“tissue of gaps” as the Irishman’s coat.</p>

<p class='c000'>Attempts have been made (including some by persons deserving
all respect, and thoroughly acquainted with the subject)
to give Pope a high place, on the score of his charges to
“follow nature.” Unfortunately this is mere translation of
Boileau, of Vida, and of Horace, in the first place: and, still
more unfortunately, the poet’s own arguments on his doctrine
show that what <em>he</em> meant by “following nature,” and what <em>we</em>
mean by it, are two quite different things. He, usually at
least, means “stick to the usual, the ordinary, the commonplace.”
Just so the legendary King of Siam, had he written an <cite>Art of
Poetry</cite>, would have said “Follow nature, and do not talk about
such unnatural things as ice and snow.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Regarded merely as a manual of the art of Pope’s own
poetry, without prejudice to any other, and as a satire on the
faults of other kinds, without prejudice to the weaknesses of
his own, the <cite>Essay</cite> is not merely an interesting document, but
a really valuable one. Its cautions against desertion of nature
in the directions of excess, of the unduly fantastic, are sound
to this day: and its eulogies of ancient writers, though perhaps
neither based on very extensive and accurate first-hand knowledge,
nor specially appropriate to the matter in hand, contain
much that is just in itself. One of the weakest parts, as might
have been expected, is the treatment of rules, licences, and
faults. The poet-critic practically confesses the otiosity of the
whole system by admitting that a lucky licence is a rule, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>that it is possible, as one of his own most famous and happiest
lines says,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>

      <div class='line'>“To snatch a grace beyond the reach of art.”</div>

<p class='c008'>And when he paraphrases Quintilian to the effect that you

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“With the same spirit that the author writ,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>and judge the whole, not the parts, he again goes perilously
near to jettison his whole system.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the same way consistency is the last thing that can be
claimed for his chapters, as they may be called, on conceit, on
language, “numbers” (the most famous and the most ingenious
passage of the <cite>Essay</cite>), extremes, “turns,” the Ancient and
Modern quarrel, &#38;c. The passage on Critics is among the
best—for here sheer good sense (even in the temporary, much
more in the universal, meaning) tells—and the historical sketch
of them, though not too accurate, is vigorous.</p>

<p class='c000'>The much later <cite>Epistle</cite> is far more desultory, and inevitably
tinged by those personal feelings which many years of literary
squabble had helped ill-health and natural disposition
to arouse in Pope. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Epistle to Augustus.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But its general critical
attitude is not different. He is angry with the revival of old
literature which Watson and Allan Ramsay in Scotland, Oldys
and others in England, were beginning, hints sneers even at
Milton and the “weeds on Avon’s bank,” is at least as hackneyed
as he is neat in his individual criticisms on poets nearer his own
day, and defends poetry and literature generally in a patronising
and half-apologetic strain. In fact, what he has really at
heart is to be politely rude to George II.; not to give any
critical account of English literature.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the <cite>Essay on Criticism</cite> is too important a thing not to
require a little more notice here. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Remarks on Pope as a critic</i>,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It is extremely desultory;
but so is the <span lang="la"><cite>Epistola ad Pisones</cite></span>, and it is by no
means certain that Pope was not wise in falling
back upon the Roman method, instead of emulating
the appearance of system in the <span lang="fr"><cite>Art Poétique</cite></span>. This latter
emphasises faults; Pope’s <span lang="fr"><i>causerie</i></span> veils promiscuousness in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>elegant chit-chat of conversation. A bad critic is a more
dangerous person than a bad poet; and true taste is as uncommon
as true genius. Bad education is responsible for bad
taste, and we must be very careful about our own. Nature is
the guide; the “rules” are but methodised nature. We derive
them, however, not from nature but from the ancient poets,
whom we must study. Even in licences we must follow them.
Bad critics are made by various causes, from ignorance and
party spirit to personal animus. A good critic is candid,
modest, well-bred, and sincere. The sort of history of criticism
which concludes the piece makes it specially surprising that
Johnson should have been so much kinder to Pope’s learning
than he was to Dryden’s; but the author of the actual <cite>Essay
on Criticism</cite>, and the author of the unhappily but projected
<cite>History</cite> of it, were too thoroughly in agreement about poetry,
and even about criticism itself, to make the latter quite an
impartial judge of the former.</p>

<p class='c000'>When we pass from generals to particulars Pope’s cleverness
at least appears more than ever. The sharply separated, neatly
flying, and neatly ringing couplets deliver “one, two” in the
most fascinating cut-and-thrust style, not without a brilliant
parry now and then to presumed (and never very formidable)
objections. The man’s perfect skill in the execution of his own
special style of poetry raises, and in this case not delusively,
the expectation that he will know his theory as well as his
practice. The “good sense,” the “reason,” are really and not
merely nominally present. A great deal of what is said is quite
undoubtedly true and very useful, not merely for reproof and
correction in point of critical and poetical sin, but actually for
instruction in critical and poetical righteousness.</p>

<p class='c000'>But on further examination there is too often something
wanting; nay, there is too often no real root of the matter
present. The preliminary flourishes are well enough. And
certainly no school will quarrel—though each school may take
the privilege of understanding the words in its own way—with
the doctrine “Follow Nature.” But</p>

      <div class='line'>“One science only will one genius fit”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>is notoriously false to nature, and if intended as a hint to the
critic, can only result in too common mistakes and injustices.
So, too, when we pass from the glowing eulogy of Nature,
and of her union with Art, to the Rules, there is a most deplorable
gap. Those Rules, “discovered not devised,” are
“nature methodised.” Very good. This means, if it means
anything, a very true thing—that the Rules are extracted
from observed works of genius. But how, a most fervent
admirer of the Greeks may ask, did it happen that the Greeks
discovered <em>all</em> these rules? How, especially, did it happen that
they did so, when some kinds of literature itself were notoriously
neither discovered nor devised? And when we get a little
further, and are bidden to</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Know well each Ancient’s proper character,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>we may, or rather must, reply, “It is most necessary; but you
will neglect the Moderns at your peril.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In short, here as elsewhere, Pope’s dazzling elocution, winged
with a distinct if narrow conception of his general purpose, flies
right enough in the inane, but makes painfully little progress
when it lights on the prosaic ground. The picture of “young
Maro,” with a sort of ciphering book before him, “totting up”
Homer, Nature, and the Stagirite, and finding them all exactly
equivalent, is really far more ludicrous than those flights of
metaphysical fancy at which critics of Pope’s school delight to
gird; while the very climax of another kind of absurdity is
reached by the accordance to the Ancients, not merely of the
prerogative of laying down the rule always to be followed, but
of the privilege of making the not-to-be-imitated exception. So
again, fine as is the Alps passage, the famous doctrine of a “little
learning” is an ingenious fallacy. It is not the little learning
acquired, but the vast amount of ignorance left, that is dangerous.
The admirable couplet,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“True Wit is nature to advantage drest;</div>
      <div class='line'>What oft was thought, but ne’er so well expressed,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>though in itself the best thing in the whole poem, is unluckily
placed, because this sensation of familiarity beneath novelty is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>constantly given by those very “conceits” which Pope is denouncing.
On “Language” and “Numbers” he is too notoriously
speaking to a particular brief. And as for his more general
cautions throughout, they are excellent sense for the most part,
but have very little more to do with criticism than with any
other function of life. A banker or a fishmonger, an architect,
artist, or plain man, will no doubt be the better for avoiding
extremes, partisanship, singularity, fashion, mere jealousy
(personal or other), ignorance, pedantry, vice. And if he turns
critic he will find these avoidances still useful to him, but not
more specially useful than in his former profession.</p>

<p class='c000'>What then was the critical attitude which was expressed so
brilliantly, and which gave Pope a prerogative influence over
all the orthodox criticism of his own century in
England and even elsewhere? <span class='sni side12'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>and the critical attitude of his group.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It can be sketched
very fairly as being a sort of compromise between
a supposed following of the ancients, and a real
application, to literature in general and to poetry in particular,
of the general taste and cast of thought of the time.
The following of the Ancients—it has been often pointed out
already—was, as the Articles of the Church of England have it,
a “corrupt following”: those who said Aristotle meant now
nobody more ancient than Boileau, now no one more ancient
than Vida, scarcely ever any one more ancient than Horace.
The classics as a whole were very little studied, at least by
those who busied themselves most with modern literature; and
it had entered into the heads of few that, after all, the standards
of one literature might, or rather must, require very considerable
alteration before they could apply to another.<a id='r596'></a><a href='#f596' class='c019'><sup>[596]</sup></a> But Greek
and Roman literature presented a body of poetry and of most
other kinds, considerable, admittedly excellent, and mostly composed
under the influence of distinct and identical critical
principles. Very few men had a complete knowledge of even a
single modern literature; hardly a man in France knew Old
French as a whole, hardly a man in England, except mere
antiquaries, knew Old English even as a part. There was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>probably not a man in Europe till Gray (and Gray was still
young at Pope’s death) who had any wide reading at once in
classical literature and in the mediæval and modern literatures
of different countries. Accordingly the principles of ancient
criticism, not even in their purity fully adequate to modern
works, and usually presented, not in their purity but in garbled
and bastardised form, were all that they had to stand by.</p>

<p class='c000'>This classical, or pseudo-classical, doctrine was further affected,
in the case of literature generally, by the <em>ethos</em> of the
time, and, in the case of poetry, by the curious delusion as to
hard and fast syllabic prosody which has been noticed in connection
with Bysshe. Classicism, in any pure sense, was certainly
not to blame for this, for everybody with the slightest
tinge of education knew that the chief Latin metre admitted
the substitution of trisyllabic for dissyllabic feet in every place
but one, and most knew that this substitution was even more
widely permitted by Greek in a standard metre, approaching
the English still nearer. But it had, as we have seen, been a
gradually growing delusion, for a hundred and fifty years, in
almost every kind of non-dramatic poetry.</p>

<p class='c000'>As for the general tendency, the lines of that are clear—though
the arbitrary extension and stiffening of them remain
a little incomprehensible. Nature was to be the test; but an
artificialised Nature, arranged according to the fashion of a town-haunting
society—a Nature which submitted herself to a system
of convention and generalisation. In so far as there was any
real general principle it was that you were to be like everybody
else—that singularity, except in doing the usual thing best,
was to be carefully avoided. Pope, being a man of genius,
could not help transcending this general conception constantly
by his execution, not seldom by his thought, and sometimes in
his critical precepts. But it remains the conception of his time
and of himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>The writers whom we have been discussing, since we parted
with Dennis, have all been considerable men of letters,
who in more or less degree busied themselves with
criticism. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Philosophical and Professional Critics.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> We must now pass to those who, without
exactly deserving the former description, undertook the subject
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>either, as part of those “philosophical” inquiries which, however
loosely understood, were so eagerly and usefully pursued
by the eighteenth century, or as direct matter of professional
duty. The first division supplies Lord Kames in Scotland
and “Hermes” Harris in England. Whether we are right
in reserving Shaftesbury, Hume, Adam Smith, &#38;c., from it, so
as to deal with them from the Æsthetic side in the next volume,
may be matter of opinion.</p>

<p class='c000'>To the second belong Trapp, Blair, and Campbell. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Trapp.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Trapp
need not detain us very long; but as first occupant of the first
literary chair in England, and so the author of a
volume of <span lang="la"><i>Prælections</i></span> respectable in themselves, and
starting a line of similar work which, to the present day, has
contributed admirable critical documents, he cannot be omitted.
He was the author of one of the wittiest epigrams<a id='r597'></a><a href='#f597' class='c019'><sup>[597]</sup></a> on record,
but he did not allow himself much sparkle in his lectures.<a id='r598'></a><a href='#f598' class='c019'><sup>[598]</sup></a>
Perhaps, indeed, he was right not to do so.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hugh Blair, half a century later than Trapp, in 1759, started,
like him, the teaching of modern literature in his own country.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Blair.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He had the advantage, as far as securing a popular
audience goes, of lecturing in English, and he was undoubtedly
a man of talent. The <cite>Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles
Lettres</cite>,<a id='r599'></a><a href='#f599' class='c019'><sup>[599]</sup></a> which were delivered with great <span lang="fr"><i>éclat</i></span> for nearly a quarter
of a century from the Chair of their subject, are very far, indeed,
from being devoid of merit. They provide a very solid, if a
somewhat mannered and artificial instruction, both by precept
and example, in what may be called the “full-dress plain
style” which was popular in the eighteenth century. They are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>as original as could be expected. The critical examination of
Addison’s style, if somewhat meticulous, is mostly sound, and
has, like Johnson’s criticisms of Dryden and Pope, the advantage
of thorough sympathy, of freedom from the drawback—so
common in such examinations—that author and critic are standing
on different platforms, looking in different directions, speaking,
one may almost say, in mutually incomprehensible tongues.
The survey of Belles Lettres is, on its own scheme, ingenious
and correct: there are everywhere evidences of love of Literature
(as the lover understands her), of good education and reading,
of sound sense. Blair is to be very particularly commended
for accepting to the full the important truth that “Rhetoric”
in modern times really means “Criticism”; and for doing all he
can to destroy the notion, authorised too far by ancient critics,
and encouraged by those of the Renaissance, that Tropes and
Figures are not possibly useful classifications and names, but fill
a real arsenal of weapons, a real cabinet of reagents, by the
employment of which the practitioner can refute, or convince, or
delight, as the case may be.</p>

<p class='c000'>But with this, and with the further praise due to judicious
borrowings from the ancients, the encomium must cease.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Lectures on Rhetoric.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In Blair’s general critical view of literature the
eighteenth-century blinkers are drawn as close as
possible. From no writer, even in French, can more “awful
examples” be extracted, not merely of perverse critical assumption,
but of positive historical ignorance. Quite early in the
second Lecture, and after some remarks (a little arbitrary, but
not valueless) on delicacy and correctness in taste, we find,
within a short distance of each other, the statements that “in
the reign of Charles II. such writers as <cite>Suckling and Etheridge</cite>
were held in esteem for dramatic composition,” and later, “If
a man shall assert that Homer has no beauties whatever, that
he holds him to be a dull and spiritless writer, and that he
<em>would as soon peruse any legend of old knight-errantry</em> as the
<cite>Iliad</cite>, then I exclaim that my antagonist is either void of all
taste,” &#38;c. Here, on the one hand, the lumping of Suckling
and Etherege together, and the implied assumption that not
merely Suckling, but Etherege, is a worthless dramatist, gives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>us one “light,” just as the similar implication that “an old
legend of knight-errantry” is necessarily an example of dulness,
spiritlessness, and absence of beauty, gives us another.
That Blair lays down, even more peremptorily than Johnson,
and as peremptorily as Bysshe, that the pause in an English
line may fall after the 4th, 5th, 6th, or 7th syllable, and no
other, is not surprising; and his observations on Shakespeare
are too much in the usual “faults-saved-by-beauties” style to
need quotation. But that he cites, with approval, a classification
of the great literary periods of the world which excludes the
Elizabethan Age altogether, is not to be omitted. It stamps
the attitude.</p>

<p class='c000'>These same qualities appear in the once famous but now little
read <cite>Dissertation on Ossian</cite>.<a id='r600'></a><a href='#f600' class='c019'><sup>[600]</sup></a> <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Dissertation on Ossian.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> That, in the sense of the word on
which least stress is laid in these volumes, this
“Critical Dissertation” is absolutely <em>un</em>critical does
not much matter. Blair does not even attempt to
examine the evidence for and against the genuineness of the
work he is discussing. He does not himself know Gaelic;
friends (like Hector M’Intyre) have told him that they heard
Gaelic songs very like <cite>Ossian</cite> sung in their youth; there are
said to be manuscripts; that is enough for him. Even when
he cites and compares parallel passages—the ghost-passage and
that from the book of Job, Fingal’s “I have no son” and <cite>Othello</cite>—which
derive their whole beauty from exact coincidence with
the Bible or Shakespeare, he will allow no kind of suspicion to
cross his mind. But this we might let pass. It is in the manner
in which he seeks to explain the “amazing degree of regularity
and art,” which he amazingly ascribes to Macpherson’s redaction,
the “rapid and animated style,” the “strong colouring of
imagination,” the “glowing sensibility of heart,” that the most
surprising thing appears. His citations are as copious as his
praises of them are hard to indorse. But his critical argument
rests almost (not quite) wholly on showing that <cite>Fingal</cite> and
<cite>Temora</cite> are worked out quite properly on Aristotelian principles
by way of central action and episode, and that there are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>constant parallels to Homer, the only poet whom he will allow
to be Ossian’s superior. In short, he simply applies to <cite>Ossian</cite>
Addison’s procedure with <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>. The critical piquancy
of this is double. For we know that <cite>Ossian</cite> was powerful—almost
incredibly powerful—all over Europe in a sense quite
opposite to Blair’s; and we suspect, if we do not know, that Mr
James Macpherson was quite clever enough purposely to give it
something of the turn which Blair discovers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The charge which may justly be brought against Blair—that
he is both too exclusively and too purblindly “belletristic”—cannot
be extended to Henry Home, Lord Kames.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Kames.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Johnson, whom Kames disliked violently, and who
returned the dislike with rather good-natured if slightly contemptuous
patronage, dismissed the <cite>Elements of Criticism</cite>, 1761,<a id='r601'></a><a href='#f601' class='c019'><sup>[601]</sup></a>
as “a pretty Essay, which deserves to be held in some estimation,
though much of it is chimerical.”<a id='r602'></a><a href='#f602' class='c019'><sup>[602]</sup></a> The sting of this lies,
as usual, in the fact that it is substantially true, though by no
means all the truth. The <cite>Elements of Criticism</cite> is a pretty
book, and an estimable one, and, what is more, one of very
considerable originality. Its subtlety and ingenuity are often
beyond Johnson’s own reach; it shows a really wide knowledge
of literature, modern as well as ancient; and it is surprisingly,
though not uniformly, free from the special “classical” purblindness
of which Johnson and Blair are opposed, but in their
different ways equal, examples. Yet a very great deal of it <em>is</em>
“chimerical,” and, what is worse, a very great deal more is,
whether chimerical or not in itself, irrelevant. It presents a
philosophical treatise, vaguely and tentatively æsthetic rather
than critical, yoked in the loosest possible manner to a bundle of
quasi-professorial exercises in Lower and Higher Rhetoric. The
second part might not improperly be termed “Critical Illustrations
of Rhetoric.” The first could only be properly entitled
“Literary Illustrations of Morals.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course this excellent Scots lawyer and ingenious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>“Scotch metaphysician” had strong precedents to urge for
making a muddle of Moral Philosophy and Literary
Criticism. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Elements of Criticism.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It has been pointed out that Aristotle
himself is not a little exposed to the same imputation.
But Kames embroils matters to an extent never surpassed,
except by those, to be found in every day, who are incapable
of taking the literary point of view at all, and who simply
treat literature as something expressing agreement or disagreement
with their moral, political, religious, or other views. He
seems himself to have had, at least once, a slight qualm. “A
treatise of ethics is not my province: I carry my view no
farther than to the elements of criticism, in order to show that
the fine arts are a subject of reasoning as well as of taste.”<a id='r603'></a><a href='#f603' class='c019'><sup>[603]</sup></a> If
this was his rule he certainly gives himself the most liberal
indulgence in applying it. His First Chapter is devoted to
“Perceptions and Ideas in a Train”; the second (an immensely
long one, containing a good third of the first volume) to “Emotions
and Passions”; while the whole of the rest till the end
of the seventeenth chapter is really occupied by the same class of
subject. Kames excels in that constantly ingenious, and often
acute, dissection of human nature which was the pride and
pleasure of his century and his country, but which is a little
apt to pay itself with clever generalisations as if they were
<span lang="la"><i>veræ causæ</i></span>. In one place we find a distribution of all the
pleasures of the senses into pain of want, desire, and satisfaction.
In another<a id='r604'></a><a href='#f604' class='c019'><sup>[604]</sup></a> the philosopher solemnly informs us, “I
love my daughter less after she is married, and my mother less
after a second marriage; the marriage of my son or my father
diminishes not my affection so remarkably.” An almost burlesque
illustration of the procedure of the school is given in the
dictum,<a id='r605'></a><a href='#f605' class='c019'><sup>[605]</sup></a> “Where the course of nature is joined with Elevation
the effect must be delightful; and hence the singular beauty of
smoke ascending in a calm morning.” When one remembers
this, and comes later<a id='r606'></a><a href='#f606' class='c019'><sup>[606]</sup></a> to the admirable remark, “Thus, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>account for an effect of which there is no doubt, any cause,
however foolish, is made welcome,” it is impossible not to say
“Thou sayest it”; as also in another case, where he lays it
down that “Were corporeal pleasures dignified over and above
[<i>i.e.</i>, beside the natural propensity which incites us to them]
with a place in a high class, they would infallibly disturb the
balance of the mind by outweighing the social affections. This
is a satisfactory final cause for refusing to these pleasures any
degree of dignity.”<a id='r607'></a><a href='#f607' class='c019'><sup>[607]</sup></a> I am tempted to quote Kames’s philosophy
of the use of tobacco<a id='r608'></a><a href='#f608' class='c019'><sup>[608]</sup></a> also, but the stuff and method of his first
volume must be sufficiently intelligible already.</p>

<p class='c000'>The second, much more to the purpose, is considerably less
interesting. A very long chapter deals with Beauty of Language
with respect to Sound, Signification, Resemblance between Sound
and Signification, and Metre. It is abundantly stocked with
well-chosen examples from a wide range of literature, and full
of remarks, generally ingenious and sometimes both new and
bold, as where at the outset Kames has the audacity to contradict
Aristotle, by implication at least, and lay it down that “of
all the fine arts, painting and sculpture only are in their nature
imitative.”<a id='r609'></a><a href='#f609' class='c019'><sup>[609]</sup></a> But it is not free from the influence of the idols
of its time. Of such, in one kind, may be cited the attribution
to Milton of “many careless lines”;<a id='r610'></a><a href='#f610' class='c019'><sup>[610]</sup></a> for if there is one thing
certain in the risky and speculative range of literary dogmatism,
it is that Milton never wrote a “careless” line in his
life. If his lines are ever bad (and perhaps they are sometimes),
they are bad deliberately and of malice. In another
and more serious kind may be ranged the predominating determination
to confuse the sensual with the intellectual side of
poetry. This, of course, is Kames’s root-idea; but that it is a
root of evil may be shown sufficiently by the following passage
in his discussion of the pause—in relation to which subject he
is as wrong as nearly all his contemporaries. He is talking of
a pause between adjective and substantive.<a id='r611'></a><a href='#f611' class='c019'><sup>[611]</sup></a> What occurs to
him is that “a quality cannot exist independent of a subject,
nor are they separable even in imagination, because they make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>part of the same idea, and for that reason, with respect to melody
as well as to sense, it must be disagreeable to bestow upon the
adjective a sort of independent existence by interjecting a pause
between it and its substantive.” His examples are no doubt
vitiated by the obsession of the obligatory “middle” pause,
which makes him imagine one between adjective and substantive
in</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The rest, his many-coloured robe concealed,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>where the only real pause, poetic as well as grammatical, is at
“rest.” But his principle is clear, and it is as clearly a wrong
principle. It ignores the great fact glanced at above, that the
pleasure of poetry is double—intellectual <em>and</em> sensual—and that
the two parts are in a manner independent of each other. And
in the second place, even on its own theory, it credits the mere
intellect with too sluggish faculties. In the first line which
Kames suggests as “harsh and unpleasant” for this reason,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Of thousand bright inhabitants of air,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>the pause at “bright” is so slight a one that some might deny
its existence. But if it be held necessary, can we refuse to the
<span lang="la"><i>subtilitas intellectus</i></span> the power of halting, for the second of
a second, to conceive the joint idea of number and brightness,
before it moves further to enrich this by the notion of
“inhabitants of air”? The mere and literal Lockist may
do so; but no other will. The Figures enjoy a space which,
without being surprised at it, one grudges; and the Unities are
handled rather oddly, while a digression of some fifty pages on
Gardening and Architecture speaks for itself. The conclusion
on the Standard of Taste is singularly inconclusive; and an
interesting appendix on “terms defined and explained” presents
the singularity that not, I think, one of the terms so dealt with
has anything specially to do with literature or art at all.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nevertheless, though it is easy to be smart upon Kames, and
not very difficult to expose serious inadequacies and errors both
in the general scheme and the particular execution, the <cite>Elements
of Criticism</cite> is a book of very great interest and importance,
and worthy of much more attention than it has for a long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>time past received. To begin with, his presentation, at the
very outset of his book, of Criticism as “the most agreeable
of all amusements”<a id='r612'></a><a href='#f612' class='c019'><sup>[612]</sup></a> was one of those apparently new and
pleasant shocks to the general which are, in reality, only the
expression of an idea for some time germinating and maturing
in the public mind. Even Addison, even Pope, while praising
and preaching Criticism, had half-flouted and half-apologised for
it. Swift, a great critic on his own day, had flouted it almost
or altogether in others. The general idea of the critic had
been at worst of a malignant, at best of a harmless, pedant.
Kames presented him as something quite different,—as a man
no doubt of learning, but also of position and of the world,
“amusing,” as well as exercising himself, and bringing the fashionable
philosophy to the support of his amusement.</p>

<p class='c000'>But he did more than this. His appreciation of Shakespeare
is, taking it together (and his references to the subject are
numerous and important), the best of his age. His citations
show a remarkable relish for the Shakespearian humour, and
though he cannot clear his mind entirely from the “blemish-and-beauty”
cant, which is ingrained in the Classical theory,
and which, as we saw, infected even such a critic as Longinus, he
is far freer from it than either Johnson or Blair. In his chapter
on the Unities he comes very near to Hurd<a id='r613'></a><a href='#f613' class='c019'><sup>[613]</sup></a> (to whom, as the
<cite>Elements of Criticism</cite> preceded the <cite>Letters on Chivalry</cite> in time,
he may have given a hint) in recognising the true Romantic
Unity of Action which admits plurality so far as the different
interests work together, or contrast advantageously. He has a
most lucid and sensible exposure of the difference between the
conditions of the Greek theatre and ours. In short, he would
stand very high if he were not possessed with the pseudological
mania which makes him calmly and gravely write<a id='r614'></a><a href='#f614' class='c019'><sup>[614]</sup></a>—“Though
a cube is more agreeable in itself than a parallelopipedon,<a id='r615'></a><a href='#f615' class='c019'><sup>[615]</sup></a>
yet a large parallelopipedon set on its smaller base is by
its elevation more agreeable, and hence the beauty of a Gothic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>tower.” But this <span lang="la"><i>amabilis insania</i></span> is in itself more amiable
than insane. He wants to admit the Gothic tower, and that is
the principal thing. Magdalen, and Merton, and Mechlin may
well, in consideration of his slighting in their favour the more
intrinsic charms of a cube, afford to let a smile flicker round
their venerable skylines at his methodical insistence on justifying
admiration of them by calling them large parallelopipeda
set on their smaller ends. And the cube can console herself
with his admission of her superior intrinsic loveliness.</p>

<p class='c000'>The faults of Blair and of Kames are both, for the most part,
absent, while much more than the merit of either, in method
and closeness to the aim, is present, in the very remarkable
<cite>Philosophy of Rhetoric</cite><a id='r616'></a><a href='#f616' class='c019'><sup>[616]</sup></a> which Dr George
Campbell began, and, to some extent, composed, as early as
1750; though he did not finish and publish it till nearly thirty
years later (1777). <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Campbell.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It may indeed be admitted that this piecemeal
composition is not without its effect on the book, which
contains some digressions (especially one on Wit, Humour, and
Ridicule, and another on the cause of the pleasure received from
the exhibition of painful objects) more excrescent than properly
episodic. It is, moreover, somewhat weighted by the author’s
strictly professional and educational design, in retaining as
much of the mere business part of the ancient Rhetoric as
would or might be useful to future preachers, advocates, or
members of Parliament. Campbell, too, is a less “elegant”
writer than Blair; and his acuteness has a less vivacious play
than that of Kames. But here concessions are exhausted; and
the book, however much we may disagree with occasional expressions
in it, remains the most important treatise on the New
Rhetoric that the eighteenth century produced. Indeed, strange
as it may seem, Whately’s, its principal formal successor in the
nineteenth, is distinctly retrograde in comparison.</p>

<p class='c000'>The New Rhetoric—the Art of Criticism—this is what Campbell
really attempts. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Philosophy of Rhetoric.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He is rather chary of acknowledging
his own position, and, in fact, save in his
title, seldom employs the term Rhetoric, no doubt
partly from that unlucky contempt of scholastic appellations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>which shows itself in his well-known attack on Logic. But his
definition of “Eloquence”—the term which he employs as a
preferred synonym of Rhetoric itself—is very important, and
practically novel. The word “Eloquence, in its greatest latitude,
denotes that art or talent by which the discourse is adapted
to its end.” Now this, though he modestly shelters it under
Quintilian’s <span lang="la"><i>scientia bene dicendi</i></span> and <span lang="la"><i>dicere secundum virtutem
orationis</i></span>, asserting also its exact correspondence with Cicero’s
description of the best orator as he who <span lang="la"><i>dicendo animos delectat
audientium et docet et permovet</i></span>, is manifestly far more
extensive than the latter of these, and much less vague than the
former. In fact Rhetoric, new dubbed as Eloquence, becomes
the Art of Literature, or in other words Criticism.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been allowed that this bold and admirable challenge of
the whole province—for “discourse” is soon seen to include
“writing”—is not always so well supported. After an interesting
introduction (vindicating the challenge, and noting Kames
more especially as one who, though in a different way, had
made it before him), Campbell for a time, either because he is
rather afraid of his own boldness, or to conciliate received
opinions on the matter (or, it has been suggested, because the
book was written at different times, and with perhaps slightly
different ends), proceeds to discuss various matters which have
very little to do with his general subject. Sometimes, as in
the Chapter, before referred to, on “The Nature and Use of the
Scholastic Art of Syllogising,” he wrecks himself in a galley
which he had not the slightest need to enter. The longer discourse
on Evidence which precedes this is, of course, fully justified
on the old conception of Rhetoric, but digressory, or at
least excursory, on his own. The above-mentioned sections on
Ridicule, and on the æsthetic pleasure derivable from painful
subjects, are excursions into the debatable kinds between
literature and Ethics, though much less extravagant than those
of Kames, and perhaps, as excursions, not absolutely to be
barred or banned; while chapters vii.-x., which deal with the
“Consideration of Hearers,” &#38;c., &#38;c., are once more Aristotelian
relapses, pardonable if not strictly necessary. But not quite a
third part of the whole treatise is occupied by this First Book of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>the three into which it is divided; and not a little of this third
is, strictly or by a little allowance, to the point. The remaining
two-thirds are to that point without exception or digression
of any kind, so that the Aristotelian distribution is exactly
reversed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The titles of the two Books, “The Foundations and Essential
Properties of Elocution,” and “The Discriminating Properties
of Elocution,” must be taken with due regard to Campbell’s use
of the last word.<a id='r617'></a><a href='#f617' class='c019'><sup>[617]</sup></a> But they require hardly any other proviso
or allowance. He first, with that mixture of boldness and
straight-hitting which is his great merit, attacks the general
principles of the use of Language, and proceeds to lay down
nine Canons of Verbal Criticism, which are in the main so sound
and so acute that they are not obsolete to the present day.
There is more that is arbitrary elsewhere, and Campbell seems
sometimes to retrograde over the line which separates Rhetoric
and Composition. But it must be remembered that this line
has never been very exactly drawn, and has, both in Scotland and
in America, if not also in England, been often treated as almost
non-existent up to the present day. In his subsequent distinction
of five rhetorical Qualities of Style—Perspicuity, Vivacity,
Elegance, Animation, and Music—Campbell may be thought
to be not wholly happy. For the three middle qualities are
practically one, and it is even questionable whether Music would
not be best included with them in some general term, designating
whatever is added by style proper to Perspicuity, or the
sufficient but unadorned conveyance of meaning. As, however,
is very common, if not universal, with him, his treatment is in
advance of his nomenclature, for the rest of the book—nearly a
full half of it—is in fact devoted to the <em>two</em> heads of Perspicuity
and Vivacity, the latter tacitly subsuming all the three minor
qualities. And there is new and good method in the treatment
of Vivacity, as shown first by the choice of words, secondly by
their number, and thirdly by their arrangement, while a section
<span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>under the first head on “words considered as sounds” comes
very near to the truth. That there should be a considerable
section on Tropes was to be expected, and, as Campbell treats
it, it is in no way objectionable. His iconoclasm as to logical
Forms becomes much more in place, and much more effective, in
regard to rhetorical Figures.</p>

<p class='c000'>One, however, of the best features of the work has hardly yet
been noticed; and that is the abundance of examples, and the
thorough way in which they are discussed. To a reader turning
the book over without much care it may seem inferior as a
<em>thesaurus</em> to Kames, because the passages quoted are as a rule
embedded in the text, and not given separately, in the fashion
which makes of large parts of the <cite>Elements of Criticism</cite> a sort
of anthology, a collection of beauties or deformities, as the
case may be. But this is in accordance with the singularly
businesslike character of Campbell’s work throughout. And if
it also seem that he does not launch out enough in appreciation
of books or authors as wholes, let it be remembered that English
criticism was still in a rather rudimentary condition, and that the
state of taste in academic circles was not very satisfactory. It
would not, of course, be impossible to produce from him examples
of those obsessions of the time which we have noticed in his two
compatriots, as we shall notice them in the far greater Johnson.
But he could not well escape these obsessions, and he suffers
from them in a very mild form.</p>

<p class='c000'>James Harris,<a id='r618'></a><a href='#f618' class='c019'><sup>[618]</sup></a> author of <cite>Hermes</cite> (and of the house of Malmesbury,
which was ennobled in the next generation), is perhaps
the chief writer whom England, in the narrower sense,
has to set against Blair, Kames, and Campbell in
mid-eighteenth century. <span class='sni side4'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Harris.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But he is disappointing. It would
not be reasonable to quarrel with the <cite>Hermes</cite> itself for not
being literary, because it does not pretend to be anything but
grammatical; and the <cite>Philosophical Arrangements</cite>, though they
do sometimes approach literature, may plead benefit of title for
not doing so oftener. But the <cite>Discourse on Music, Painting, and
Poetry</cite>, and the <cite>Philological Enquiries</cite>—in which Philology is
expressly intimated to mean “love of letters” in the higher
<span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>sense—hold out some prospects. The performance is but little.
Readers of Boswell will remember that Johnson, though the
author of <cite>Hermes</cite> was very polite to him, both personally and
with the pen, used, to his henchman’s surprise and grief, to
speak very roughly of Harris, applying to him on one occasion
the famous and damning phrase, “a prig, and a bad prig,” and
elsewhere hinting doubts as to his competency in Greek. That
the reproach of priggishness was deserved (whether with the
aggravation or not) nobody can read half-a-dozen pages of
Harris without allowing,—his would-be complimentary observation
on Fielding<a id='r619'></a><a href='#f619' class='c019'><sup>[619]</sup></a> would determine by itself. But the principal
note of Harris, as a critic, is not so much priggishness as confused
superficiality. These qualities are less visible in the
<cite>Dialogue</cite> (which is an extremely short, not contemptible, but
also not unimportant, exercitation in the direction of Æsthetic
proper) than in the <cite>Enquiries</cite>, which were written late in life, and
which, no doubt, owe something of their extraordinary garrulity
to “the irreparable outrage.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This book begins, with almost the highest possible promise for
us, in a Discussion of the Rise of Criticism, its various species,
Philosophical, Historical, and Corrective, &#38;c. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Philological Enquiries.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It goes
on hardly less promisingly, if the mere chapter-headings
are taken, with discourses on Numbers, Composition,
Quantity, Alliteration, &#38;c.; the Drama, its Fable and
its Manners, Diction, and, at the end of the second part, an impassioned
defence of Rules. But the Third, which promises a
discussion of “the taste and literature of the Middle Age,” raises
the expectation almost to agony-point. Here is what we have
been waiting for so long: here is the great gap going to be
filled. At last a critic not merely takes a philosophic-historic
view of criticism, but actually proposes to supplement it with
an inquiry into those regions of literature on which his predecessors
have turned an obstinately blind eye. As is the
exaltation of the promise, so is the aggravation of the disappointment.
Harris’s first part, though by no means ill-planned,
is very insufficiently carried out, and the hope of
goodness in the third is cruelly dashed beforehand by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>sentence, “At length, after a long and barbarous period, when
the shades of monkery began to retire,” &#38;c. The writer’s mere
enumeration of Renaissance critics is very haphazard, and his
remarks, both on them and their successors, perfunctory in the
extreme. He hardly dilates on anybody or anything except—following
the tradition from Pope and Swift—on Bentley and
his mania for correction and conjecture.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the second part he gives himself more room, and is better
worth reading, but the sense of disappointment continues. In
fact, Harris is positively irritating. He lays it down, for instance,
that “nothing excellent in a literary way happens
merely by chance,” a thesis from the discussion of which much
might come. But he simply goes off into a loose discussion of
the effects and causes of literary pleasure, with a good many
examples in which the excellence of his precept, “seek the
cause,” is more apparent than the success of his own researches.
The rest is extremely discursive, and seldom very satisfactory,
being occupied in great part with such tenth-rate stuff as Lillo’s
<cite>Fatal Curiosity</cite>. As for Harris’s defence of the Rules, he does
not, in fact, defend them at all; but, as is so common with controversialists,
frames an indictment, which no sensible antagonist
would ever bring, in order to refute it. He says that “he never
knew any genius cramped by rules, and had known great
geniuses miserably err by neglecting them.” A single example
of this last would have been worth the whole treatise. But
Harris does not give it. Finally, “the Taste and Literature of
the Middle Age” seem to him to be satisfactorily discussed by
ridiculing the Judgment of God, talking at some length about
Byzantine writers, giving a rather long account of Greek philosophy
in its ancient stages, quoting freely from travellers to
Athens and Constantinople, introducing “the Arabians,” with
anecdotes of divers caliphs, saying something of the Schoolmen,
a little about the Provençal poets, something (to do
him justice) of the rise of accentual prosody,<a id='r620'></a><a href='#f620' class='c019'><sup>[620]</sup></a> and a very, very
little about Chaucer, Petrarch, Mandeville, Marco Polo, Sir John
Fortescue, and—Sannazar! “And now having done with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>Middle Age,” he concludes—having, that is to say, shown that,
except a <span lang="fr"><i>pot-pourri</i></span> of mainly historical anecdote, he knew
nothing whatever about it; or, if this seem harsh, that his
knowledge was not of any kind that could possibly condition
his judgment of literature favourably. In fact, no one shows
that curious eighteenth-century confusion of mind, which we
shall notice frequently in other countries, better than Harris.
He is, as we have seen, a fervent devotee of the Rules—he
believes<a id='r621'></a><a href='#f621' class='c019'><sup>[621]</sup></a> that, before any examples of poetry, there was an
abstract schedule of Epic, Tragedy, and everything else down to
Epigram, which you cannot follow but to your good, and cannot
neglect but to your peril. Yet, on the one hand, he feels the
philosophic impulse, and on the other, the literary and historical
curiosity, before which these rules were bound to vanish.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>“Estimate” Brown: his</i> History of Poetry.</div>

<p class='c000'>A few allusions,<a id='r622'></a><a href='#f622' class='c019'><sup>[622]</sup></a> in contemporaries of abiding fame, have kept
half alive the name—though very few, save specialists, are likely
to be otherwise than accidentally acquainted with
the work—of John Brown of Newcastle, author of
the once famous <cite>Estimate of the Manners and Principles
of the Times</cite>,<a id='r623'></a><a href='#f623' class='c019'><sup>[623]</sup></a> and afterwards, when he
had gained reputation by this, of a <cite>Dissertation on the Rise
of Poetry and Music</cite>,<a id='r624'></a><a href='#f624' class='c019'><sup>[624]</sup></a> later still slightly altered, and re-christened
<cite>History of the Rise and Progress of Poetry</cite>.<a id='r625'></a><a href='#f625' class='c019'><sup>[625]</sup></a> The
<cite>Estimate</cite> itself is one of those possibly half-unconscious
pieces of quackery which from time to time put (in a manner
which somehow or other tickles the longer ears among their
contemporaries) the old cry that <em>every</em>thing is rotten in
the state of Denmark. There is not much in it that is
directly literary; the chief point of the kind is an attack
on the Universities: it may be noted that quacks generally do
attack Universities. The <cite>Dissertation-History</cite> is a much less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>claptrap piece, but far more amusing to read. Brown is one
of those rash but frank persons who attempt creation as well
as criticism; and those who will may hear how</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Peace on Nature’s lap reposes [why not <span lang="la"><i>vice versa</i></span>?]</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>and so forth. The difference of the two forms is not important.
In the second, Brown simply left out Music, so far as he could,
as appealing to a special public only. He believes in <cite>Ossian</cite>,
then quite new. He thinks it contains “Pictures which no
civilised modern could ever <em>imbibe</em> in their strength, nor consequently
could ever <em>throw out</em>”—an image so excessively
Georgian (putting aside the difficulty of imbibing a picture)
that one has to abbreviate comment on it. For the rest, Brown
rejoices and wallows in the naturalistic generalisation of his
century. He begins, of course, with the Savage State, lays it
down that, at religious and other festivals, men danced and sang,
that then organised professional effort supplemented unorganised,
and so poets arose. Then comes about a sort of Established
Choir, whence the various kinds are developed. And we
have the Chinese—the inevitable Chinese—Fow-hi, and Chao-hao,
and all their trumpery. Negligible as an authority, Brown
perhaps deserves to rank as a symptom.</p>

<p class='c000'>But we must leave minorities, and come to him who is here
ὁ μέγας.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is no reason to doubt that Johnson’s critical opinions
were formed quite early in life, and by that mixture of natural
bent and influence of environment which, as a rule,
forms all such opinions. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Johnson: his preparation for criticism.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> There has been a tendency
to regard, as the highest mental attitude, that of considering
everything as an open question, of being ready to
reverse any opinion at a moment’s notice. As a matter of fact,
we have record of not many men who have proceeded in this
way; and it may be doubted whether among them is a single
person of first-rate genius, or even talent. Generally speaking,
the men whose genius or talent has a “stalk of carle hemp” in
it find, in certain of the great primeval creeds of the world,
political, ecclesiastical, literary, or other, something which suits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span>their bent. The bent of their time may assist them in fastening
on to this by attraction or repulsion—it really does not
much matter which it is. In either case they will insensibly,
from an early period, choose their line and shape their course
accordingly. They will give a certain independence to it; they
will rarely be found merely “swallowing formulas.” It is the
<em>other</em> class which does this, with leave reserved to get rid of
the said formulas by a mental emetic and swallow another set,
which will very likely be subjected to the same fate. But the
hero will be in the main <span lang="la"><i>Qualis ab incepto</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Johnson was in most things a Tory by nature, his Toryism
being conditioned, first by that very strong bent towards a sort
of transcendental scepticism which many great Tories have
shown; secondly, by the usual peculiarities of social circumstance
and mental constitution; and lastly, by the state of
England in his time—a state to discuss which were here impertinent,
but which, it may be humbly suggested, will not be
quite appreciated by accepting any, or all, of the more ordinary
views of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p class='c000'>His view of literature was in part determined by these
general influences, in part—perhaps chiefly—by special impinging
currents. His mere birth-time had not very much to do
with it—Thomson, Dyer, Lady Winchelsea, who consciously or
unconsciously worked against it, were older, in the lady’s case
much older, than he was; Gray and Shenstone, who consciously
worked against it in different degrees, were not much younger.<a id='r626'></a><a href='#f626' class='c019'><sup>[626]</sup></a>
The view was determined in his case, mainly no doubt by that
natural bent which is quite inexplicable, but also by other
things explicable enough. Johnson, partly though probably not
wholly in consequence of his near sight, was entirely insensible
to the beauties of nature; he made fun of “prospects”;
he held that “one blade of grass is like another” (which it most
certainly is not, even in itself, let alone its surroundings);
he liked human society in its most artificial form—that provided
by towns, clubs, parties. In the second place, his ear was only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>less deficient than his eye. That he did not care for music, in
the scientific sense, is not of much importance; but it is quite
clear that, in poetry, only an extremely regular and almost mathematical
beat of verse had any chance with him. Thirdly, he
was widely read in the Latin Classics, less widely in Greek,
still more widely in the artificial revived Latin of the Renaissance
and the seventeenth century.<a id='r627'></a><a href='#f627' class='c019'><sup>[627]</sup></a> Fourthly, he was, for a
man so much given to reading—for one who ranged from Macrobius
in youth to <cite>Parismus and Parismenus</cite> in age, and from
<cite>Travels in Abyssinia</cite> to <cite>Prince Titi</cite>—not very widely read either
in mediæval Latin or in the earlier divisions of the modern languages;
indeed, of these last he probably knew little or nothing.
Fifthly, the greatest poet in English immediately before his
time, and the greatest poet in English during his youth and
early manhood, had been exponents, the one mainly, the other
wholly, of a certain limited theory of English verse. Sixthly,
the critical school in which he had been brought up was strictly
neo-classic. Seventhly, and to conclude, such rebels to convention
as appeared in his time were chiefly men whom he
regarded with unfriendly dislike, or with friendly contempt.
Nor can it be said that any one of the contemporary partisans of
“the Gothick” was likely to convince a sturdy adversary. Walpole
was a spiteful fribble with a thin vein of genius; Gray a
sort of Mr Facing-Both-Ways in literature, who had “classical”
mannerisms worse than any of Johnson’s own, and whose
dilettante shyness and scanty production invited ridicule.
Both were Cambridge men (and Johnson did not love Cambridge
men, nor they him), and both were Whigs. Percy and
Warton were certainly not very strong as originals, and had
foibles enough even as scholars. But whether these reasons
go far enough, or do not so go, Johnson’s general critical attitude
never varies in the least.<a id='r628'></a><a href='#f628' class='c019'><sup>[628]</sup></a> It was, as has been said, probably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>formed quite early; it no doubt appeared in those but
dimly known contributions to periodical literature which
defrayed so ill the expense of his still more dimly known first
twenty years in London. We have from him no single treatise,
as in the cases of Dante and Longinus, no pair of treatises, as in
the case of Aristotle, to go upon. But in the four great documents
of <cite>The Rambler</cite>, <cite>Rasselas</cite>, the Shakespeare <cite>Preface</cite>, and
the <cite>Lives</cite>, we see it in the two first rigid, peremptory, in the
<cite>Preface</cite>, curiously and representatively uncertain, in the last
conditioned by differences which allow it somewhat freer play,
and at some times making a few concessions, but at others more
pugnacious and arbitrary than before.</p>

<p class='c000'>The critical element in <cite>The Rambler</cite> is necessarily large; but
a great deal of it is general and out of our way.<a id='r629'></a><a href='#f629' class='c019'><sup>[629]</sup></a> <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Rambler <i>on Milton</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Directly concerning
us are the papers on the aspects (chiefly
formal) of Milton’s poetry—especially versification—on
which Addison had not spoken, with some smaller papers
on lesser subjects. The Miltonic <span lang="la"><i>examen</i></span> begins at No. 86.
Johnson is as uncompromising as the great Bysshe himself on
the nature of English prosody. “The heroick measures of the
English language may be properly considered as pure or mixed.”
They are pure when “the accent rests on every second syllable
through the whole line.” In other words, “purity” is refused
to anything but the strict iambic decasyllable. Nay, he goes
further; this is not only “purity” and “the completest harmony
possible,” but it ought to be “exactly kept in distichs” and in
the last line of a (verse) paragraph.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nevertheless, for variety’s sake, the “mixed” measure is
allowed; “though it always injures the harmony of the line
considered by itself,” it makes us appreciate the “harmonious”

<span class='pageno' id='Page_481'>481</span>grudging, and in strictness illogical, licence is limited merely to
substitution of other dissyllabic feet for the pure iamb. In</p>

<p class='c008'>the rigid Johnson insists on the spondaic character, “the accent
is on two syllables together and both strong”; while he would

<p class='c008'>as a pyrrhic (“both syllables are weak”). A trochee (“deviation
or inversion of accent”) is allowed as a “mixture” in the first
place, but elsewhere is “remarkably inharmonious,” as, for
instance, in Cowley’s beautiful line,</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>The next paper (88) passes, after touching other matters, to
“elision,” by which he means (evidently not even taking tri-syllabic
possibility into consideration) such a case as</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Wisdom to folly as nourishment to wind.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>This licence, he says, is now disused in English poetry; and adds
some severe remarks on those who would revive or commend it.
He even objects to the redundant ending in heroic poetry.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the third paper (90) he comes to Pauses; and once more
plays the rigour of the game. The English poet, in connecting
one line with another, is <em>never</em> to make a full pause at less than
three syllables from the beginning or end of a verse; and in all
lines pause at the fourth or sixth syllable is best. He gives a
whole paper to Milton’s accommodation of the sound to the
sense, and winds up his Miltonic exercitations, after a very
considerable interval, with a set critique (139) of <cite>Samson
Agonistes</cite>, partly on its general character as an Aristotelian
tragedy (he decides that it has a beginning and end, but no
middle, poor thing!) and partly on details. These papers
show no <span lang="la"><i>animus</i></span> against Milton. There are even expressions
of admiration for him, which may be called enthusiastic.
But they do show that the critic was not in range with his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_482'>482</span>author. Almost every one of his axioms and postulates is
questionable.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the remaining critical papers in the <cite>Rambler</cite> it is very
important to notice No. 121, “On the Dangers of Imitation, and
the Impropriety of imitating Spenser.” <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>On Spenser.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Johnson’s
acuteness was not at fault in distrusting, from his
point of view, the consequences of such things as the <cite>Castle of
Indolence</cite> or even the <cite>Schoolmistress</cite>; and he addresses a direct
rebuke to “the men of learning and genius” who have introduced
the fashion.<a id='r630'></a><a href='#f630' class='c019'><sup>[630]</sup></a> In so far as his condemnation of “echoes”
goes he is undoubtedly not wrong, and he speaks of the idol of
Neo-Classicism, Virgil, with an irreverent <span lang="la"><i>parrhesia</i></span><a id='r631'></a><a href='#f631' class='c019'><sup>[631]</sup></a> which, like
many other things in him, shows his true critical power. But
on Spenser himself the other idols—the <span lang="la"><i>idola specus</i></span> rather than
<span lang="la"><i>fori</i></span>—blind him. In following his namesake in the condemnation
of Spenser’s language he is, we may think, wrong; yet this
at least is an arguable point. But in regard to the Spenserian
stanza things are different. Johnson calls it “at once difficult
and unpleasing; tiresome to the ear from its uniformity, and to
the attention by its length,” while he subsequently goes off into
the usual error about imitating the Italians. No truce is here
possible. That the Spenserian is not easy may be granted at
once, but Johnson was certainly scholar enough to anticipate
the riposte that, not here only, it is “hard to be good.” As
for “unpleasing,” so much the worse for the ear which is not
pleased by the most exquisite harmonic symphony in the long
and glorious list of stanza-combinations. As for monotony, it is
just as monotonous as flowing water. While as for the Italian
parallel, nothing can probably be more to the glory of Spenser
than this; just as nothing can be more different than the pretty,
but cloying, rhyme even of Tasso, nay, sometimes even of Ariosto,
and the endless unlaboured beauty of Spenser’s rhyme-sound.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_483'>483</span>It is no valid retort that this is simply a difference of taste. If
a man, as some men have done, says that Spenser is pleasing
and Dryden and Pope are <em>not</em>, then the retort is valid. When
the position is taken that <em>both</em> rhythms are pleasing, both really
poetical, but poetical in a different way, the defender of it may
laugh at all assailants.</p>

<p class='c000'>The criticism of the English historians which immediately
follows has an interest chiefly of curiosity, because it was written
just at the opening of the great age of the department
with which it deals. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>On History and Letter-writing.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Prejudices of different kinds
would always have prevented Johnson from doing
full justice to Robertson, to Hume, and, most of all, to Gibbon;
but, as it is, he deals with nobody later than Clarendon, and
merely throws back to Raleigh and Knolles. Very much the
same drawback attends the criticism on Epistolary writing: for
here also it was the lot of Johnson’s own contemporaries, in
work mostly not written, and hardly in a single case published,
at the date of the <cite>Rambler</cite>, to remove the reproach of England.
But the paper on Tragi-Comedy (156) is much more important.</p>

<p class='c000'>For here, as in other places, we see that Johnson, but for the
combination of influences above referred to, might have taken
high, if not the highest, degrees in a very different
school of criticism. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>On Tragi-comedy.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He puts the great rule <span lang="la"><i>Nec
quarta loqui</i></span> into the dustbin, with a nonchalance exhibiting
some slight shortness of sight; for the very argument he uses
will sweep with this a good many other rules to which he still
adheres. “We violate it,” he says coolly, “without scruple and
without inconvenience.” He is equally iconoclastic about the
Five Acts, about the Unity of Time, while he blows rather hot
and cold about tragi-comedy in the sense of the mixing of
tragic and comic scenes. But the close of the paper is the most
remarkable, for it is in effect the death-knell of the neo-classic
system, sounded by its last really great prophet. “<i>It ought to
be the first endeavour of a writer to distinguish nature from
custom, or that which is established because it is right from that
which is right only because it is established; that he may neither
violate essential principles by a desire of novelty, nor debar himself
from the attainment of beauties within his view by a needless fear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_484'>484</span>of breaking rules which no literary dictator had authority to
enact.</i>”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh! the lands of Milnwood, the bonny lands of Milnwood,
that have been in the name of Morton twa hundred years; they
are barking and fleeing, infield and outfield, haugh and holme!”
With this utterance, this single utterance, all the ruling doctrines
of sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth century criticism receive
notice to quit.<a id='r632'></a><a href='#f632' class='c019'><sup>[632]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The well-known “Dick Minim” papers in the <cite>Idler</cite> (60, 61)
are excellent fun, and perhaps Johnson’s chief accomplishment
in the direction of humour. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>“<cite>Dick Minim.</cite>”<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The growth of criticism
in Dick, his gradual proficiency in all the critical
commonplaces of his day (it is to be observed that Johnson, like
all true humourists, does not spare himself, and makes one of
Minim’s <span lang="fr"><i>secrets de Polichinelle</i></span> a censure of Spenser’s stanza), his
addiction to Johnson’s pet aversion, “suiting the sound to
the sense,” and his idolatry of Milton, are all capitally done.
Indeed, like all good caricatures, the piece is a standing piece
to consult for the fashions and creeds which it caricatures. But
it neither contains nor suggests any points of critical doctrine
that we cannot find elsewhere, and it is only indirectly serious.<a id='r633'></a><a href='#f633' class='c019'><sup>[633]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The Dissertation upon Poetry of Imlac in <cite>Rasselas</cite> (chap. x.)
may be less amusing; but it is of course much more serious.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Rasselas.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> There can be no reasonable doubt that Imlac gives
as much of Johnson’s self as he chose to put, and could
put, in character: while it is at least possible that his sentiments
are determined in some degree by the menacing appearances
of Romanticism. Imlac finds “with wonder that in almost
all countries the most ancient poets are reputed the best”; that
“early writers are in possession of nature and their successors
of art”; that “no man was ever great by imitation”; that he
must observe everything and observe for himself, but that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_485'>485</span>must do it on the principle of examining, “not the individual,
but the species.” He is to remark “general properties and
large appearances. He does not number the streaks of the
tulip or describe the different shapes in the verdure of the
forest,” but must “exhibit prominent and striking features,”
neglecting “minuter discriminations.” In the same way his
criticism of life must be abstracted and generalised; he must be
“a being superior to time and place”; must know many
languages and sciences; must by incessant practice of style
“familiarise to himself every delicacy of speech and grace of
harmony.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Surely a high calling and election! yet with some questionable
points in it. If the poet must not count the streaks of the
tulip, if he must merely generalise and sweep; if he must consult
the laziness and dulness of his readers by merely portraying
prominent and striking features, characteristics alike obvious to
vigilance and carelessness—then even Dryden will not do, for
he is too recondite and conceited. Pope alone must bear the
bell. Lady Winchelsea’s horse in twilight, the best part of a
century earlier; Tennyson’s ashbuds in the front of March, the
best part of a century later, are equally “streaks of the tulip,”
superfluous if not even bad. Habington’s picture of the pitiless
northern sunshine on the ice-bound pilot, and Keats’s of the
perilous seas through the magic casements, must be rejected,
as too unfamiliar and individual. The poetic strangeness and
height are barred <span lang="fr"><i>en bloc</i></span>. Convention, familiarity, generalisation—these
are the keys to the poetical kingdom of heaven.
The tenant of Milnwood has a fresh enfeoffment!</p>

<p class='c000'>The Shakespeare Preface is a specially interesting document,
because of its illustration, not merely of Johnson’s native
critical vigour, not merely of his imbibed eighteenth-century
prejudices, but of that peculiar position of
compromise and reservation which, as we have said
and shall say, is at once the condemnation and the salvation
of the English critical position at this time. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Shakespeare Preface.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Of the first there
are many instances, though perhaps none in the <cite>Preface</cite> itself
quite equal to the famous note on the character of Polonius,
which has been generally and justly taken as showing what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_486'>486</span>a triumph this failure of an edition might have been. Yet
even here there is not a little which follows in the wake of
Dryden’s great eulogy, and some scattered observations of
the highest acuteness, more particularly two famous sentences
which, though Johnson’s quotation is directed to a minor
matter—Shakespeare’s learning—settle beforehand, with the
prophetic tendency of genius, the whole monstrous absurdity
of the Bacon-Shakespeare theory.<a id='r634'></a><a href='#f634' class='c019'><sup>[634]</sup></a> The rest, however, is, if not
exactly a zigzag of contradiction, at least the contrasted utterance
of two distinct voices. Shakespeare has this and that
merit of nature, of passion; but “his set speeches are commonly
cold and weak.” “What he does best he soon ceases to do.”
Johnson, here also, has no superstitious reverence for the
Unities, and even speaks slightly of dramatic rules; nay, he
suggests “the recall of the principles of the drama to a new
examination,” the very examination which Lessing was to give
it. But he apologises for the period when “<cite>The Death of
Arthur</cite> was the favourite volume,” and hints a doubt whether
much of our and his own praise of Shakespeare is not “given
by custom and veneration.” “He has corrupted language by
every mode of depravation,” yet Johnson echoes Dryden “when
he describes anything you more than see it, you feel it too.”
A singular triumph of “depraved language.” In short, throughout
the piece it is now Johnson himself who is speaking, now
some one with a certain bundle of principles or prejudices
which Johnson chooses to adopt for the time.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was with these opinions on the formal and substantial
nature of poetry and of criticism that Johnson, late in life, sat
down to the <cite>Lives of the Poets</cite>,<a id='r635'></a><a href='#f635' class='c019'><sup>[635]</sup></a> one of the most
fortunate books in English literature. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Lives of the Poets.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In very few
cases have task and artist been so happily associated. For
<span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>almost all his authors, he had biographical knowledge such as
no other living man had, and the access to which has long been
closed. If, now and then, his criticism was not in touch with
his subjects, this was rare: and the fact gave a certain value
even to the assertions that result—for <em>we</em>, do what we will,
cannot see Milton quite as Johnson saw him, and so his view is
valuable as a corrective. By far the greater part of these
subjects belonged to one school and system of English poetry, a
school and system with which the critic was at once thoroughly
familiar and thoroughly in sympathy. And, lastly, the form of
the work, with its subdivision into a large number of practically
independent and not individually burdensome sections, was well
suited to coax a man who suffered from constitutional indolence,
and who for many years had been relieved from that pressure
of necessity which had conquered his indolence occasionally,
and only occasionally, earlier. No other man, it is true, has
had quite such a chance: but he must indeed have a sublime
confidence, both in the strength of his principles and in the
competence of his talents, who thinks that, if he had the chance,
he could do the task better than Johnson did his.</p>

<p class='c000'>The work, of course, is by no means equal throughout: and it
could not be expected to be. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Their general merits.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Some was merely old work,
dating from a much less mature period of the writer’s
genius, and made to serve again. Some was on
subjects so trivial that good nature, or simple indolence, or, if any
one pleases, an artistic reluctance to break butterflies on so huge
a wheel, made the criticisms almost as insignificant as the
criticised. Here and there extra-literary prejudice—political-ecclesiastical,
as in the case of Milton; partly moral, partly
religious, and, it is to be feared, a little personal, as in that of
Swift—distorted the presentation. And it is quite possible that
a similar distortion, due to the same causes or others, was in the
case of Gray intensified by a half-unconscious conviction that
Gray’s aims and spirit, if not his actual poetical accomplishments,
were fatal to the school of poetry to which the critic
himself held.</p>

<p class='c000'>But make allowance for all this, and with how great a thing
do the <cite>Lives</cite> still provide us! In that combination of biography
<span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>and criticism, which is so natural that it is wonderful it should
be so late,<a id='r636'></a><a href='#f636' class='c019'><sup>[636]</sup></a> they are all but the originals, and are still almost the
standard. They are full of anecdote, agreeably and crisply
told, yet they never descend to mere gossip: their criticism of
life is almost always just and sound, grave without being
precise, animated by the same melancholy as that of the
<cite>Vanity of Human Wishes</cite>, but in milder mood and with touches
of brightness. Their criticism of literature is all the more
valuable for being the criticism of their time. When we read
Johnson’s remarks on Milton’s minor poems it is foolish to rave,
and it is ignoble to sneer. The wise will rejoice in the opportunity
to understand. So when Johnson bestows what seems to
us extraordinary and unintelligible praise on John Pomfret’s
<cite>Choice</cite>,<a id='r637'></a><a href='#f637' class='c019'><sup>[637]</sup></a> he is really praising a moral tract couched in verse not
unpleasing in itself, and specially pleasing to his ear. When he
speaks less favourably of <cite>Grongar Hill</cite>, he is speaking of a piece
of nature-poetry, not arranged on his principle of neglecting
the streak of the tulip, and availing itself of those Miltonic
licences of prosody which he disapproved. But we shall never
find that, when the poetry is of the stamp which he recognises,
he makes any mistake about its relative excellence: and we
shall find that, in not a few cases, he is able to recognise excellence
which belongs to classes and schools not exactly such as
he approves. And, lastly, it has to be added that for diffused
brilliancy of critical expression, subject to the allowances and
conditions just given, the <cite>Lives</cite> are hardly to be excelled in any
language. It is not safe to neglect one of them, though no
doubt there are some six or seven which, for this reason or that,
take precedence of the rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>The “Cowley” has especial interest, because it is Johnson’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_489'>489</span>only considerable attempt at that very important part of
criticism, the historical summary of the characteristics
of a poetical period or school. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Cowley.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> And, though far
from faultless, it is so important and so interesting in its kind
that it ranks with his greatest Essays. Only that singular
impatience of literary history, as such, which characterised the
late Mr Matthew Arnold, and which not infrequently marred
his own critical work, can have prevented him from including,
in his Johnsonian <span lang="fr"><i>points de repère</i></span>, the Essay which launched,
and endeavoured to make watertight, the famous definition
of the “Metaphysical” School—of the school represented
earlier by Donne, and later by Cowley himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>The phrase itself<a id='r638'></a><a href='#f638' class='c019'><sup>[638]</sup></a> has been both too readily adopted and too
indiscriminately attacked. Taken with the ordinary meaning
of “metaphysical,” it may indeed seem partly meaningless and
partly misleading. Taken as Johnson meant it, it has a meaning
defensible at least from the point of view of the framer, and
very important in critical history. Johnson (it is too often
forgotten) was a scholar; and he used “metaphysical” in its
proper sense—of that which “comes after” the physical or
natural. Now, it was, as we have seen, the whole principle of
his school of criticism—their whole critical contention—that <em>they</em>
were “following nature.” The main objection to the poetry of
what Dryden calls the “last Age”—what we call, loosely but
conveniently, “Elizabethan” poetry—was that its ideas, and still
more its expressions, went beyond and behind nature, substituted
afterthoughts and unreal refinements for fact. It would
be delightful to the present writer to defend the Metaphysicals
here—but it would not be to the question.</p>

<p class='c000'>Political and religious prejudice accounts, as has been said,
for much in the <cite>Milton</cite>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Milton.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But it will not fully account for the
facts. The at first sight astonishing, and already
often referred to, criticisms on the minor poems show
a perfectly honest and genuine dislike to the form as well as
to the matter, to the manner as well as to the man. If Johnson
<span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>calls <cite>Lycidas</cite> “harsh,” it is because he simply does not hear its
music; he can even call the songs in <cite>Comus</cite> “not very musical
in their numbers.” When of the, no doubt unequal but often
splendid, sonnets he can write, “of the best it can only be said
that they are not bad,” he gives us the real value of his criticism
immediately afterwards by laying it down that “the fabric of a
sonnet, however adapted to the Italian language, has <em>never</em> succeeded
in ours.” And when he has earlier stated that “all that
short compositions can commonly attain is sweetness and elegance,”
we see in this the whole thing. Milton is condemned
under statute (though the statute is hopelessly unconstitutional
and unjust) on certain counts; on others his judge, though capable
and perfectly honest, does not know the part of the code
which justifies the accused. Johnson is listening for couplet-music
or stanzas with regular recurrence of rhyme, for lines
constituted entirely on a dissyllabic, or entirely on a trisyllabic,
basis. He does not find these things: and he has no organ
to judge what he does find.</p>

<p class='c000'>With the lives of Dryden and Pope we are clear of all difficulties,
and the critic is in his element. The poets whom he is
criticising occupy the same platform as he does; they
have in fact been themselves the architects of that
platform. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Dryden <i>and</i> Pope.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> There is no fear of the initial incompatibilities which,
when aggravated by accident, lead to the apparent enormities of
the <cite>Milton</cite> Essay, and which, even when not so aggravated, condition
the usefulness, though they may positively increase the
interest, of the <cite>Cowley</cite>. But there is more than this. In no
instance, perhaps, was Johnson so well in case to apply his
biographical and critical treatment as in regard to Dryden
and Pope. With the latter he had himself been contemporary;
and when he first came to London the traditions even
of the former were still fresh, while there were many still living
(Southerne the chief of them) who had known glorious John well.
Further, Johnson’s peculiar habits of living, his delight in conversation
and society, his excellent memory, and his propensity
to the study of human nature, as well as of letters, furnished
him abundantly with opportunities. Yet, again, his sympathy
with both, on general literary sides, was not unhappily mixed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>and tempered by a slight, but not uncharitable or Puritanic,
disapproval of their moral characters, by regret at Dryden’s
desertion of the Anglican Church, and at the half-Romanist
half-freethinking attitude of Pope to religion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The result of all this is a pair of the best critical Essays in
the English language. Individual expressions will of course
renew for us the sense of difference in the point of view. We
shall not agree that Dryden “found English poetry brick and
left it marble,” and we shall be only too apt to take up the
challenge, “If Pope be not a poet, where is poetry to be found?”
even if we think the implied denial, to which the challenge was
a reply, an absurdity. And we may find special interest as well
as special difference in the condemnation even of these masters
for attempting Pindarics, because Pindarics “want the essential
constituent of metrical compositions, the stated recurrence of
settled numbers,” seeing in it a fresh instance of that Procrustean
tyranny of suiting the form to the bed, not the bed to
the form, which distinguishes all neo-classic criticism. But
these points occur rarely. The criticism, as a whole, is not
merely perfectly just on its own scheme, but requires very little
allowance on others; nor, in the difficult and dangerous art of
comparative censorship, will any example be found much surpassing
Johnson’s parallel of the two poets.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the <cite>Milton</cite> and the <cite>Cowley</cite> we find Johnson dealing with
schools of poetry which he regards as out of date and imperfect;
in the <cite>Dryden</cite> and the <cite>Pope</cite>, with subjects
which are not to him subjects of any general controversy,
but which he can afford to treat almost entirely on
their merits. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Collins <i>and</i> Gray.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In the <cite>Collins</cite> and the <cite>Gray</cite> we find a new relation
between poet and critic—the relation of decided, though
not yet wholly declared, innovation on the part of the poets,
and of conscious, though not yet quite wide-eyed and irreconcilable,
hostility on the part of the critic. The expression of
this is further differentiated by the fact that Johnson regarded
Collins with the affection of a personal friend, and the generous
sympathy of one who, with all his roughness, had a mind
as nearly touched by mortal sorrows as that of any sentimentalist;
while it is pretty clear, though we have no positive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>evidence for it, that he reciprocated the personal and political
dislike which Gray certainly felt for him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The result was, in the case of Collins, a criticism rather inadequate
than unjust, and not seldom acute in its indication of
faults, if somewhat blind to merits; in that of Gray, one which
cannot be quite so favourably spoken of, though the censure
which has been heaped upon it—notably by Lord Macaulay
and Mr Arnold—seems to me very far to surpass its own injustice.
Johnson’s general summing up—that Gray’s “mind had
a large grasp; his curiosity<a id='r639'></a><a href='#f639' class='c019'><sup>[639]</sup></a> was unlimited, and his judgment
cultivated; he was likely to love much where he loved at all,
but fastidious and hard to please”—is acute, just, and far from
ungenerous. That on the Elegy—“The four stanzas beginning,
‘Yet even these bones,’ are to me original; I have never seen
the notions in any other place. Yet he that reads them here
persuades himself that he has always felt them. Had Gray
written often thus, it had been vain to blame and useless to
praise him”—is a magnificent and monumental compliment, said
as simply as “Good morning.” He is absolutely right when he
says that in all Gray’s Odes “there is a kind of cumbrous splendour
that we wish away,” for there never was such an abuser of
“poetic diction” (to be a poet) as Gray was. Yet undoubtedly
the Essay is not satisfactory; it has not merely, as the <cite>Collins</cite>
has, blindness, but, what the <cite>Collins</cite> has not, that obvious <em>denigration</em>,
that determination to pick holes, which always vitiates
a critique, no matter what learning and genius be bestowed on it.
And the probable reasons of this are interesting. It has been
said that they were possibly personal in part. We know that
Gray spoke rudely of Johnson; and there were many reasons
why Johnson might rather despise Gray, though he certainly
should not have called him “dull.”</p>

<p class='c000'>On the whole, however, I have little doubt—and it is this
which gives the essay its real interest for me—that one main
reason of Johnson’s antipathy to Gray’s poetry was the same as
that for which we like it. He suspected, if he did not fully
perceive, the romantic snake in Gray’s classically waving grass.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_493'>493</span>And he had on his own grounds good reason for suspecting it.
Gray might use Greek and Latin tags almost extravagantly.
But he sedulously eschewed the couplet; and, while preferring
lyric, he chose lyrical forms which, though Johnson was too
much of a scholar to dare to call them irregular, violated his
own theories of the prompt and orderly recurrence of rhyme,
and the duty of maintaining a length of line as even as possible.
The sense of nature, the love of the despised “prospect,” was
everywhere; even the forbidden “streak of the tulip” might be
detected. And, lastly, Gray had too obvious leanings to classes
of subject and literature which lay outside of the consecrated
range—early English and French, Welsh, Norse, and the like.
It is no real evidence of critical incapacity, but of something
quite the reverse, that Johnson should have disliked Gray. He
spied the great Romantic beard under the Pindaric and Horatian
muffler—and he did not like it.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the whole, it may be safely said that, however widely a
man may differ from Johnson’s critical theory, he will, provided
that he possesses some real tincture of the critical
spirit himself, think more and more highly of the
<cite>Lives of the Poets</cite> the more he reads them, and the
more he compares them with the greater classics of
critical literature. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The critical greatness of the</i> Lives <i>and of Johnson</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> As a book, they have not missed their due
meed of praise; as a critical book, one may think that they have.
The peculiarity of their position as a body of direct critical
appraisement of the poetical work of England for a long period
should escape no one. But the discussion of them, which
possesses, and is long likely to possess, prerogative authority as
coming from one who was both himself a master of the craft
and a master of English, admirable and delightful as it is and
always will be, is not, critically speaking, quite satisfactory.
Mr Arnold speaks of the Six Lives which he selected in very
high terms: but he rather pooh-poohs the others, and, even in
regard to the chosen Six, he puts upon himself—and in his
amiable, but for all that exceedingly peremptory, way, insists
in putting on his readers—a huge pair of blinkers. We are to
regard the late seventeenth and the whole of the eighteenth
century as an Age of Prose: and we are to regard Johnson,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_494'>494</span>whether he was speaking of the poets of this age or of others, as
the spokesman of an age of prose. Far be it from me to deny
that there is an element of truth in this: but it is not the whole
truth, and the critic must strive, though he may not boast, to
“find the whole.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The whole truth, as it seems to me, about Johnson is that he
was very much more than the critic of an age of prose, though
he was not (who has been? even Longinus? even Coleridge?)</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>as regards poetic criticism. He saw far beyond prose, as in
those few words of the concluding and reconciling eulogy of
Gray which have been quoted above. It is poetry and not prose
which has the gift of putting new things so that the man who
reads them ingenuously thinks that they are merely a neat statement
of what he has always thought. And Johnson was far
more than merely a critic of the eighteenth-century Neo-Classic
theory, though he was this. A most noteworthy passage in the
<cite>Rambler</cite> (No. 156), which I have purposely kept for comment
in this place, though it is delivered on the wrong side, shows us,
as the great critics always do show us, what a range of sight
the writer had. In this he expresses a doubt whether we ought
“to judge genius merely by the event,” and, applying this to
Shakespeare, takes the odd, but for an eighteenth-century critic
most tell-tale and interesting, line that if genius succeeds by
means which are wrong according to rule, we may think higher
of the genius but less highly of the work. It is hardly necessary
to point out that this is, though in no way a discreditable,
a transparent evasion of the difficulty which is pressing on the
defenders of the Rules. “Show me,” one may without irreverence
retort, “thy genius without thy works; and I will show
thee my genius by my works.” If Shakespeare shows genius in
neglecting the Rules, the inexorable voice of Logic, greater than
Fortune, greater than all other things save Fate, will point out
that the Rules are evidently not necessary, and, with something
like the Lucretian <span lang="la"><i>Te sequar</i></span>, will add, “Then for what <em>are</em> they
necessary?” But Johnson’s power is only a little soured and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_495'>495</span>not at all quenched by this. He has seen what others refused—perhaps
were unable—to see, and what some flatly denied,—that
a process of literary judgment “by the event” is possible,
and that its verdicts, in some respects at any rate, cannot
be challenged or reversed. These great critical <span lang="fr"><i>aperçus</i></span>, though
sometimes delivered half unwillingly or on the wrong side,
establish Johnson’s claim to a place not often to be given to
critics; but they do not establish it more certainly than his
surveys of his actual subjects. It was an unfortunate consequence
of Mr Arnold’s generous impatience of all but “the
chief and principal things,” and of his curious dislike to literary
history as such, that he should have swept away the minor
Lives. One may not care for Stepney or Yalden, Duke or
King, much more, or at all more, than he did. But with a
really great member of the craft his admissions and omissions,
his paradoxes, his extravagances, his very mistakes
pure and simple, are all critically edifying. How does he
apply his own critical theory? is what we must ask: and,
with Johnson, I think we shall never ask it in vain.</p>

<p class='c000'>His idea of English poetry was the application to certain
classes of subjects, not rigidly limited to, but mainly arranged
by, the canons of the classical writers—of what seemed to him
and his generation the supreme form of English language and
metre, brought in by Mr Waller and perfected by Mr Pope, yet
not so as to exclude from admiration the <cite>Allegro</cite> of
Milton and the <cite>Elegy</cite> of Gray. We may trace his applications
of this, if we have a real love of literature and
a real sense of criticism, nearly as profitably and pleasantly
in relation to John Pomfret as in relation to Alexander
Pope. We may trace his failures (as we are pleased,
quite rightly in a way, to call them), the failures arising from
the inadequacy, not of his genius, but of his scheme, not less
agreeably in relation to Dyer than in relation to Dryden. We
are not less informed by his passing the <cite>Castle of Indolence</cite>
almost <span lang="la"><i>sub silentio</i></span> than we are by that at first sight astounding
criticism of <cite>Lycidas</cite>. This Cæsar never does wrong but with
just cause—to use the phrase which was too much for the
equanimity or the intelligence of his great namesake Ben,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_496'>496</span>in the work of one whom both admired yet could not quite
stomach.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, this it is which makes the greatness of a critic. That
Johnson might have been greater still at other times need not
necessarily be denied; though it is at least open to doubt
whether any other time would have suited his whole disposition
better. But, as he is, he is great. The critics who deserve that
name are not those who, like, for instance, Christopher North
and Mr Ruskin, are at the mercy of different kinds of caprice—with
whom you must be always on the <span lang="la"><i>qui vive</i></span> to be certain
what particular watchword they have adopted, what special
side they are taking. It may even be doubted whether such a
critic as Lamb, though infinitely delightful, is exactly “great”
because of the singular gaps and arbitrariness of his likes and
dislikes. Nay, Hazlitt, one of the greatest critics of the world
on the whole, goes near to forfeit his right to the title by the
occasional outbursts of almost insane prejudice that cloud his
vision. Johnson is quite as prejudiced; but his prejudice is
not in the least insane. His critical calculus is perfectly sound
on its own postulates and axioms; and you have only to apply
checks and correctives (which are easily ascertained, and kept
ready) to adjust it to absolute critical truth. And, what is
more, he has not merely flourished and vapoured critical abstractions,
but has left us a solid reasoned body of critical judgment;
he has not judged literature in the exhausted receiver of mere
art, and yet has never neglected the artistic criterion; he has
kept in constant touch with life, and yet has never descended
to mere gossip. We may freely disagree with his judgments,
but we can never justly disable his judgment; and this is the
real criterion of a great critic.</p>

<p class='c000'>Johnson is so much the eighteenth-century orthodox critic in
quintessence (though, as I have tried to show, in transcendence
also) that he will dispense us from saying very much
more about the rank and file, the ordinary or inferior
examples, of the kind. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Minor Criticism: Periodical and other.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> If we were able to devote this
Book, or even this volume, to the subject of the present
chapter, there would be no lack of material. Critical exercitations
of a kind formed now, of course, a regular part of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_497'>497</span>the work of literature, and a very large part of its hack-work.
The <cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite> devoted much attention to the subject;
and for a great part of the century two regular <cite>Reviews</cite>,
the <cite>Critical</cite> and the <cite>Monthly</cite>,<a id='r640'></a><a href='#f640' class='c019'><sup>[640]</sup></a> were recognised organs of literary
censorship, and employed some really eminent hands, notably
Smollett and Goldsmith. The periodicals which, now in single
spies, now (about the middle of the century) in battalions, endeavoured
to renew the success of the <cite>Tatler</cite> and <cite>Spectator</cite>, were
critical by kind; and dozens, scores, hundreds probably, of separate
critical publications, large and small, issued from the press.<a id='r641'></a><a href='#f641' class='c019'><sup>[641]</sup></a>
But, with the rarest exceptions, they must take the <em>non</em>-benefit
of the warning which was laid down in the Preface to the First
Volume. Something we must say of Goldsmith; then we may
take two contrasted examples, Knox and Scott of Amwell, of
the critic in Johnson’s last days who inclined undoubtingly to
the classical, and of the critic of the same time who had qualms
and stirrings of Romanticism, but was hardly yet a heretic.
And then, reserving summary, we may close the record.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_498'>498</span>Of Goldsmith as a critic little need be said, though his pen
was not much less prolific in this than in other departments.
But the angel is too often absent, and Poor Poll distressingly
in evidence. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Goldsmith.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The <cite>Inquiry into the Present
State of Polite Learning in Europe</cite> is simply “prodigious.” It is
admirably written—Macaulay owes something to its style, which
he only hardened and brazened. The author apes the fashionable
philosophastering of the time, and throws in cheap sciolism
like the prince of journalists that he was. It is almost always
interesting; it is, where it touches life, not literature, sometimes
excellently acute; but there is scarcely a critical dictum in it
which is other than ridiculous. So in the <cite>Citizen of the World</cite>
the Author’s Club is of course delightful; but why should a
sneer at Drayton have been put in the mouth of Lien Chi
Altangi? And the miscellaneous Essays, including the <cite>Bee</cite>,
which contain so much of Goldsmith’s best work, are perhaps
the best evidences of his nullity here. When one thinks how
little it would cost anybody of Goldsmith’s genius (to find such
an one I confess would cost more) to write a literary parallel to
the magnificent <cite>Reverie</cite>, which would be even finer, it is enough
to draw iron tears down the critic’s cheek. Goldsmith on Taste,
Poetry, Metaphor, &#38;c.,<a id='r642'></a><a href='#f642' class='c019'><sup>[642]</sup></a> is still the Goldsmith of the <cite>Inquiry</cite>.
His “Account of the Augustan Age,”<a id='r643'></a><a href='#f643' class='c019'><sup>[643]</sup></a> though much better, and
(unless I mistake) resorted to by some recent critics as a source
of criticism different from that mostly prevalent in the nineteenth
century, has all the limitations of its own period. And
the Essay on Versification,<a id='r644'></a><a href='#f644' class='c019'><sup>[644]</sup></a> though it contains expressions
which, taken by themselves, might seem to show that Goldsmith
had actually emancipated himself from the tyranny of
the fixed number of syllables, contains others totally irreconcilable
with these, supports English hexameters and sapphics,<a id='r645'></a><a href='#f645' class='c019'><sup>[645]</sup></a> and
as a whole forces on us once more the reluctant belief that
he simply had no clear ideas, no accurate knowledge, on the
subject.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_499'>499</span>Vicesimus Knox<a id='r646'></a><a href='#f646' class='c019'><sup>[646]</sup></a> is a useful figure in this critical Transition
Period. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Vicesimus Knox.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> A scholar and a schoolmaster, he had some of the
advantages of the first state and some of the defects
of the less gracious second, accentuated in both cases
by the dying influences of a “classical” tradition which had
not the slightest idea that it was moribund. He carries his
admiration for Pope to such a point as to assure us somewhere
that Pope was a man of exemplary piety and goodness, while
Gay was “uncontaminated with the vices of the world,” which
is really more than somewhat blind, and more than a little
kind, even if we admit that it is wrong to call Pope a bad man,
and that Gay had only tolerable vices. He thinks, in his Fourteenth
Essay on the “Fluctuations of Taste,” that the Augustans
“arrived at that standard of perfection which,” &#38;c.; that the
imitators of Ariosto, Spenser, and the smaller poems of Milton
are “pleasingly uncouth” [compare Scott, <i>infra</i>, on the metrical
renaissance of Dyer], depreciates Gray, and dismisses the Elegy
as “a confused heap of splendid ideas”; is certain that Milton’s
sonnets “bear no mark of his genius,” and in discussing the
versions of “the sensible<a id='r647'></a><a href='#f647' class='c019'><sup>[647]</sup></a> Sappho” decides that Catullus is
much inferior to—Philips! “The Old English Poets [Essay
Thirty-Nine] are deservedly forgotten.” Chaucer, Gower, Lydgate,
and Occleve “seem to have thought that rhyme was
poetry, and even this constituent they applied with extreme
negligence”—the one charge which is unfair against even
Occleve, and which, in reference to Chaucer, is proof of utter
ignorance. Patriotism probably made him more favourable to
Dunbar, Douglas, and Lyndsay, though he groans over the
necessity of a glossary in their case also. In fact, Knox is but
a Johnson without the genius. Let it, however, be counted to
him for righteousness that he defended classical education, including
verse-writing, against its enemies, who even then
imagined vain things.</p>

<p class='c000'>John Scott of Amwell, once praised by good wits, now much
forgotten, was a very respectable critic and a poet of “glimmerings.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_500'>500</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Scott of Amwell.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In fact, I am not at all sure that he does not deserve
to be promoted and postponed to the next volume,
as a representative of the rising, not the falling, tide.
His Essays on poetry<a id='r648'></a><a href='#f648' class='c019'><sup>[648]</sup></a> exhibit in a most interesting way the
“know-not-what-to-think-of-it” state of public opinion about
the later years of Johnson. He defends <cite>Lycidas</cite> against the
Dictator; yet he finds fault with the “daystar” for acting both
as a person and an orb of radiance, and admits the “incorrectness”
of the poem, without giving us a hint of the nature or
authority of “correctness.” He boldly attacks the consecrated
<cite>Cooper’s Hill</cite>, and sets the rival eminence of Grongar against
it, pronouncing Dyer “a sublime but strangely neglected poet,”
yet picking very niggling holes in this poet himself. He often
anticipates, and oftener seems to be going to anticipate, Wordsworth,
who no doubt owed him a good deal; yet he thinks
Pope’s famous epigram on Wit “the most concise and just
definition of Poetry.” In <cite>Grongar Hill</cite> itself he thinks the
“admixture of metre [its second, certainly, if not its first great
charm] rather displeasing to a nice ear”; and though he defends
Gray against Knox, he is altogether yea-nay about <cite>Windsor
Forest</cite>, and attacks Thomson’s personifications, without remembering
that Gray is at least an equal sinner, and without
giving the author of the <cite>Seasons</cite>, and still more of the <cite>Castle of
Indolence</cite>, any just compensation for his enthusiasm of nature.
In fact, Scott is a man walking in twilight, who actually sees
the line of dawn, but dares not step out into it.</p>

Pope, as they are so numerous. Of
their whole works there is, in the former

<div class='footnote' id='f592'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r592'>592</a>. The most important of these is the
sentence on Crashaw (with whom Pope
has some points of sympathy), that he
is wanting in “design, form, fable,
which is the soul of poetry,” and
“exactness or consent of parts, which
is the body,” while he grants him
“pretty conceptions, fine metaphors,
glittering expressions, and something
of a neat cast of verse, which are properly
the dress, gems, or loose ornaments”
of it. See my friend Mr

elaborate criticism of Pope’s <cite>Odyssey</cite>,

neither praising nor blaming its subject

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f628'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r628'>628</a>. Let it be noted, however, that in
Johnson, as in most strong men, there
were certain leanings to the other side,
certain evidences of the “identity of
contradictories.” His sense of mystery,
his religiosity, his strong passions,
his tendency to violence in taste and
opinions—were all rather Romantic
than Classical.</p>

Virgil, determined to imitate at all
costs, has put in his borrowed matter
without regard to keeping.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f632'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r632'>632</a>. The chief remaining critical <span lang="la"><i>loci</i></span> in
the <cite>Rambler</cite> are the unlucky strictures
in No. 168 on “dun,” “knife,” and
“blanket” in <cite>Macbeth</cite> as “low”; and
the remarks on unfriendly criticism in
176.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f633'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r633'>633</a>. There are, of course, other passages
in the <cite>Idler</cite> touching on Criticism,—59
on the Causes of Neglect of Books,
68, 69 on Translation, 77 on “Essay

they contain nothing of exceptional
importance.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f634'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r634'>634</a>. “Jonson, ... who besides that
he had no imaginable temptation to
falsehood, wrote at a time when the
character and acquisitions of Shakespeare
were known to multitudes. His
evidence ought therefore to decide the
controversy, unless some testimony of
equal force could be opposed.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f635'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r635'>635</a>. With Johnson, as with some other
writers, I have not thought it necessary
to specify editions. I must, however,
mention Mr J. H. Millar’s issue
of the <cite>Lives</cite> (London, 1896) for the
sake of the excellent <cite>Introduction</cite> on
Johnson’s criticism.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f636'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r636'>636</a>. There are blind attempts at it even
in antiquity; but Dryden’s Lives of
Lucian and Plutarch are, like other
things of his elsewhere, the real
originals here.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f637'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r637'>637</a>. Let me draw special attention to
“John.” I once, unwittingly or carelessly,
called him “Thomas,” and I am
afraid that I even neglected to correct
the error in a second edition of the
guilty book. A man who writes
“Thomas” for “John,” in the case of
a minor poet, can, I am aware, possess
no virtues, and must expect no pardon.
But I shall always henceforth remember
to call him “Pomfret, Mr <em>John</em>.”
“Let this expiate,” as was remarked in
another case of perhaps not less mortal
sin.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f638'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r638'>638</a>. It was of course probably suggested
by Dryden (<cite>Essay on Satire</cite>, “Donne
... affects the metaphysics”), but in
Johnson’s hands is much altered and
extended.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f639'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r639'>639</a>. It must be remembered that this
word had no unfavourable connotation
with Johnson. It meant intelligent
and scholarly interest.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f640'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r640'>640</a>. Johnson’s relative estimates of the
two (<cite>Boswell</cite>, Globe ed., pp. 186, 364)
are well known; as is his apology for
the <cite>Critical</cite> Reviewers’ habit [he had
been one himself] of not reading the
books through, as the “duller” <cite>Monthly</cite>
fellows were glad to do. Later generations
have perhaps contrived to be dull
<em>and</em> not to read.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f641'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r641'>641</a>. For instance, here is one which I
have hunted for years—<cite>Essay on the
New Species of Writing founded by
Fielding, with a word or two on Modern
Criticism</cite> (London? 1751). The better-known
<cite>Canons of Criticism</cite> of Thomas
Edwards (4th ed., London, 1750) may
serve as a specimen of another kind.
It is an attack on Warburton’s <cite>Shakespeare</cite>,
uncommonly shrewd in all senses
of the word, but, as Johnson (<cite>Boswell</cite>,
Globe ed., p. 87 note) justly enough
said, of the gad-fly kind mainly. A
curious little book, which I do not
remember to have seen cited anywhere,
is the <cite>Essay upon Poetry and Painting</cite>
of Charles Lamotte (Du<em>d</em>lin (<i>sic</i>), 1742).
La Motte, who was an F.S.A., a D.D.,
and chaplain to the Duke of Montagu,
and who has the still rarer honour of
not appearing in the <cite>Dict. Nat. Biog.</cite>,
never, I think, refers to his namesake,
but quotes Voltaire and Du Bos frequently.
He is very anxious for “propriety”
in all senses, and seems a little
more interested in Painting than in
Poetry. As to the latter, he is a good
example of the devouring appetite for
sense and fact which had seized on the
critics of this time (save a few rebels)
throughout Europe. The improbabilities
of Tasso and of “Camoenus, the
Homer and Virgil of the Portuguese,”
afflict him more, because they amuse
him less, than they do in Voltaire’s own
case, and to any liberty with real or
supposed history he is simply Rhadamanthine.
“That which jars with
probability—that which shocks Sense
and Reason—can never be excused in
Poetry.” Mrs Barbauld and <cite>The Ancient

to the hemistich theory of decasyllables.</p>

<p class='c004'>The later seventeenth and at least the earlier eighteenth
century in France are perhaps more closely connected than
any other literary periods, if, indeed, they are not
practically one, like the two halves of our own
so-called “Elizabethan” time. <span class='sni side12'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Close connection of French seventeenth and eighteenth century criticism. Fontenelle.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> And this connection
we can duly demonstrate, as far as criticism is concerned.
Boileau himself outlived the junction of the
centuries by more than a decade: and the birth
of Voltaire preceded it by more than a lustrum.
The Quarrel of Ancients and Moderns—a very poor thing
certainly—revived in the new century, as if on purpose to
show the connection with the old. And, lastly, the prolonged
life of one remarkable and representative critic was almost
equally distributed over the two. Fontenelle is one of the most
interesting, if not exactly one of the most important, figures
<span class='pageno' id='Page_502'>502</span>in our whole long gallery; and if he has never yet held quite
his proper place in literary history, this is due to the facts, first,
that he was a critic more than he was anything else; and,
secondly, that he forgot the great “Thou shalt not” which
Criticism lays upon her sons, and would lay (if she had any) on
her daughters. No critic is in the least bound to produce good
work, or any work, of the constructive kind: but he is bound not
to produce that which is not good. The author of <cite>Aspar</cite> and
the <span lang="fr"><cite>Lettres du Chevalier d’Her</cite></span> ... forgot this, and paid the
penalty.<a id='r649'></a><a href='#f649' class='c019'><sup>[649]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Yet his attractions are so great that few people who have
paid him much attention have failed to be smitten with them.
M. Rigault,<a id='r650'></a><a href='#f650' class='c019'><sup>[650]</sup></a> who does not approve of him generally,
is a conspicuous example of this. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Exceptional character of his criticism.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But what we
must look to is what he has actually written himself.
His utterances are almost too tempting. In such a book as
this the expatiation which they invite must be perforce denied
them. Yet one may break proportion a little in order to do
something like justice to a critic whose like, for suggestiveness,
delicacy, and range, we shall hardly meet in the French
eighteenth century. It is indeed curious that of the three
men of his own earliest years from whom Voltaire inherits—Saint-Evremond,
Hamilton, and Fontenelle—every one should
have surpassed him in the finer traits, while all fall short of
him in force and, as he himself said, <span lang="fr"><i>diable au corps</i></span>. Saint-Evremond
we have dealt with; Hamilton<a id='r651'></a><a href='#f651' class='c019'><sup>[651]</sup></a> does not come into
our story. Fontenelle is for the moment ours.</p>

<p class='c000'>It must be confessed that he is an elusive if an agreeable
possession. From wisdom, from worldly-wisdom, from whim,
or from what not, he seems to have wished to be an enigma;
and—to borrow one of Scott’s great sentences—“the wish of
his heart was granted to his loss, and the hope of his pride has
destroyed him”—at least has certainly made him rank lower
than he would otherwise have ranked. However <span lang="fr"><i>délié</i></span>—to use
<span class='pageno' id='Page_503'>503</span>a word of his own language for which we have no single
English equivalent—however watchful, mercurial, sensitive
the reader’s spirit may be, he will, over and over again in
Fontenelle, meet passages where he cannot be sure whether
his author is writing merely with tongue in cheek, or applying
an all-dissolving irony, hardly inferior to Swift’s in power, and
almost superior in quietness and subtlety. Moreover, his
critical position is a very peculiar one, and constantly liable
to be misunderstood—if, indeed, it be not safer to say that
it is almost always difficult to apprehend with any certainty
of escaping misprision. The good folk who magisterially rebuke
Dryden as to <cite>Gorboduc</cite>, because he made mistakes about
the form of the verse and the sex of the person—even those
(one regrets to say this includes M. Rigault himself) who are
shocked at that great critic’s laudatory citations of, and allusions
to, Le Bossu—need never hope to understand Fontenelle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Few things (except that he was the author of that <cite>Plurality
of Worlds</cite> which happily does not concern us) are better known
concerning him than that he was a champion of
the Moderns. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His attitude to the “Ancient and Modern” Quarrel.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Yet, when we come to examine his
numerous and elusive writings on the subject, the
one principle of his that does emerge is a principle
which, if it chastises the Ancients with whips,
chastises the Moderns with scorpions. A man writing, as M.
Rigault wrote, in 1856, would have been a wonderful person
if he had not been misled by the great idol of Progress. But
Fontenelle was at least as far from the delusion as he was
from the date. His argument is just the contrary—that as
human wisdoms and human follies, human powers and human
weaknesses, are always the same, it is absurd to suppose that
any one period can have general and intrinsic superiority over
any other.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The</i> Dialogues des Morts.</div>

<p class='c000'>Assuredly no “modern,” whether of his days or of our own,
can find aught but confusion of face in the quiet
axiom of Laura at the end of her controversy with
Sappho,<a id='r652'></a><a href='#f652' class='c019'><sup>[652]</sup></a> “<span lang="fr">Croyez moi, après qu’on a bien raisonné
ou sur l’amour, ou sur telle autre matière qu’on voudra, on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_504'>504</span>trouve au bout du compte que les choses sont bien comme elles
sont, et que la réforme qu’on prétendroit y apporter gâterait
tout.</span>” <span lang="la"><i>Pulveris exigui jactus!</i></span> but one with a fatally magical
effect in the quarrels of criticism as of other things. And the
same is the lesson of the dialogue which follows immediately—the
best of the whole, and almost a sovereign document of our
library,—that between Socrates and Montaigne. Not only is
there no example in the literature of the dialogue, from Plato to
Mr Traill, much more apt than the “maieutic” feat of Socrates,
by which he induces Montaigne to commit himself to the
dogma, “<span lang="fr">Partout où il y a des hommes, il y a des sottises,
et les mêmes sottises</span>”; but the rest of the piece is as powerfully,
though as quietly, worked out as this crisis of it. There
is no Progress; there is no Degeneration. The distribution
may vary: the sum will not. Erasistratus maintains the same
thesis on a different matter a little later in his dialogue
with Harvey,<a id='r653'></a><a href='#f653' class='c019'><sup>[653]</sup></a> laying down the doctrine, outrageous to all the
Royal Societies of the world (though they were glad to welcome
Fontenelle as populariser, and have perhaps never had
such an one since, except Mr Huxley), that “the things which
are not necessary perhaps do get discovered in the course of
ages, the others not.” And Charles V. preaches no very different
sermon when he “makes a hare” of Erasmus by pointing
out to that dilettante republican that <span lang="fr"><i>les biens de l’esprit</i></span> are just
as much things of time and chance as crown and sceptre.<a id='r654'></a><a href='#f654' class='c019'><sup>[654]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It is, however, in Fontenelle’s actual concrete deliverances of
criticism that the resemblance to Dryden comes in most. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Other critical work.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Those
who insist that such deliverances shall be Medic-Persian,
unalterable, mathematical, true without
relation and adjustment, will not like him. To take
his utterances down in a notebook, and reproduce them at the
next examination (to provide for which process seems to be
held the be-all and end-all of modern criticism), would not
do at all. When Fontenelle praises Corneille at the expense
of Racine, you have to think whether he is speaking what he
thinks or merely as <span lang="fr"><i>le neveu de son oncle</i></span>; when he says other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_505'>505</span>things, whether he is a “Modern” at the time and to the extent
of saying something which he knows will cause the “Ancients”
grinding torments; when he sketches<a id='r655'></a><a href='#f655' class='c019'><sup>[655]</sup></a> a theory of poetic criticism
of the most sweeping <span lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span> kind from Principles of
Beauty down through Kinds to Rules, whether he really means
this, or is conciliating somebody, or laughing in his sleeve at
somebody, or the like. But this—at least for some tastes—only
adds piquancy to his observations, and they have now and
then surprising justice, freshness, freedom from the prejudices
of time, country, and circumstance. The <span lang="fr"><cite>Histoire du Théâtre
Français</cite></span>, for instance, which he has prefixed to his <span lang="fr"><cite>Vie de
Corneille</cite></span>, may be based on second-hand information, and, with
our fuller knowledge, it may not be very hard to pick holes in
it. But it is an extraordinary production for a representative
man of letters at a time when hardly any such man, in any
country of Europe, was free from ignorant contempt of the early
vernaculars. The brief eleven-articled “parallel between Racine
and Corneille” is of course somewhat partisan; but it will give
the partisans on the other side some trouble to prove it unjust.
The “Remarks on Aristophanes,” and on the Greek theatre
generally, are obviously “modern” and intended to tease; but
they are uncommonly shrewd, and so are the <span lang="fr"><cite>Réflexions sur la
Poétique</cite></span> and those on “Poetry in General.” It is wonderful
that even an antagonist of Boileau, and a sworn paradoxer,
should, at this time, have been able to see the beauty of the
Père Le Moyne’s splendid couplet on the Sicilian Vespers,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="fr">Quand du Gibel ardent les noires Euménides</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr">Sonneront de leur cor ces Vêpres homicides,</span>”—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>where we are more than half-way from Du Bartas and Aubigné
to Victor Hugo. The mere image—this new “vision of the
guarded mount,” with the black Furies silhouetted against the
flaming cone, and the explosions of the volcano deepening the
bugle-call to massacre—is fine: the means taken to make it
poetical are finer. The use of the proper names, and the
cunning arrangement of epithet and noun in <span lang="fr"><cite>noires Euménides</cite></span>
and <span lang="fr"><cite>Vêpres homicides</cite></span>, and the sharp blasts of the long and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_506'>506</span>short <i>o</i>'s in the second line, are more than Hugonian, they are
positively Miltonic: and the couplet will serve to keep a man
in Mr Arnold’s “torpid and dismal” stage of later middle life
cheerful for an evening, and whensoever he remembers it afterwards.
True, Fontenelle admits demurely that he knows “vespers”
and “Eumenides” are something of an anachronism in
conjunction, and proposes a slight alteration to suit this objection
of “correctness.” But this is his way; and the wonderful thing
is that he should have admired it at all—should have actually
tasted this heady wine of poetry. As he finishes the paragraph
in his own quaint style,<a id='r656'></a><a href='#f656' class='c019'><sup>[656]</sup></a> “<span lang="fr">Il était bien aisé, même à de grands
poètes, de ne pas trouver</span>” this couplet: and in his time it
would have been still easier even for great critics not to do
justice to it, and not to see that it is to these things “so easy
for the poet not to find” that it is the critic’s business to look.</p>

<p class='c000'>The general remarks on Comedy which he prefixed to a
collection of his efforts in that kind are not negligible; but
in those on Eclogue,<a id='r657'></a><a href='#f657' class='c019'><sup>[657]</sup></a> and still more in the <span lang="fr"><cite>Digression sur Les
Anciens et Les Modernes</cite></span>, the curse, or at least the gainsaying, of
the Quarrel is upon him, and the main drift is not merely
digressive but aggressive and excessive. In the <cite>Digression</cite> he
anticipates (as he did in so many things) the materialist-rationalist
explanations of the later eighteenth century by
climate, fibres of the brain, &#38;c. Here he becomes scientific,
and therefore necessarily ceases to be of importance in
literature.</p>

<p class='c000'>But he always regains that importance before long—in his
Discourse of the Origin of Fable, in his Academic Discourses
and Replies, in many a fragment and isolated remark. Even in
his <cite>Eloges</cite>—mostly devoted (there are nearly two volumes of
them) to scientific personages from Leibniz and Newton downwards—the
unconquerable critical power of the man shows
itself, subject to the limitations noted. The world is sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_507'>507</span>not allowed to know anything of its greatest critics, and
Fontenelle is an example of this. But those who have won
something of that knowledge of criticism which it is the
humble purpose of this book to facilitate, will not slight the
man who, at the junction of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries, could flirt in the face of Ancients and Moderns
alike the suggestion (which Mr Rigmarole doubtless borrowed
from him) that all times are “pretty much like our own,”
and could see and hear the sable sisters sounding the tocsin on
the flaming crest of Mongibel.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fontenelle is elusive, but comprehensible by the imagination.
La Motte,<a id='r658'></a><a href='#f658' class='c019'><sup>[658]</sup></a> his inseparable companion in the renewed sacrilege
of the Moderns, seems an easier, but is really a harder,
personage to lay hold of. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>La Motte.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It is indeed not extremely
difficult to explain his attitude to the Ancients by the fact that
he knew no Greek; and his exaltation of prose by a consciousness
(wherein he has left a family by no means extinct) that his
own verses were worth very little. But it is so easy not to
write verses if you cannot; and not to write about Greek if
you do not know it! And the problem is further complicated
by the facts that at least some judges, who are not exactly the
first comers, such as Fontenelle himself and Voltaire, maintained
that La Motte <cite>could</cite> write verses,—and that, so far from being
“a fellow who had failed,” he had obtained the greatest scenic
success of the early eighteenth century with <span lang="es"><cite>Inès de Castro</cite></span>, and,
what is more, had deserved it. But for once, as also again in
Pope’s case, the dangerous explanation of physical defects and
constitutional weakness seems to have some validity. The invulnerable
nonchalance of his friend Fontenelle had met the
damnation of <cite>Aspar</cite> by a cool tearing up of the piece, and
an undismayed advance upon the fate of the <span lang="la"><i>plusquam semel
damnatus</i></span>; La Motte, at twenty or at little more, felt the
similar misfortune of <span lang="fr"><cite>Les Originaux</cite></span> so severely that he
actually went to La Trappe for a time. Before middle life
he was blind and a cripple. The irritability which did not
show itself in his temper (for he was the most amiable of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_508'>508</span>men) would seem to have transferred itself to his literary
attitude, not affecting his politeness of expression, but inducing
a sort of “rash” of paradox.</p>

<p class='c000'>To trace the vagaries of this might not be unamusing, but
would certainly be excessive here. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His “Unity of Interest.”</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> La Motte, it seems to me,
had considerably less natural literary taste than
Fontenelle; and of the controversy<a id='r659'></a><a href='#f659' class='c019'><sup>[659]</sup></a> (it was not
his antagonist’s fault if it was not a very acrimonious
one) between him and Madame Dacier one cannot
say much more than that the lady is very aggressive, very
erudite, and very unintelligent; the gentleman very suave,
rather ignorant, and of an intelligence better, but not much
better, directed; while both are sufficiently distant from any
true critical point of view. Yet once, as was not unnatural in
the case of a very clever man who was at least endeavouring to
form independent conclusions, La Motte did hit upon a great
critical truth when,<a id='r660'></a><a href='#f660' class='c019'><sup>[660]</sup></a> discussing the Three Unities, he laid it
down that there is after all only <em>one</em> Unity which is of real
importance, and that this is the “Unity of Interest,” to which
all the others are subsidiary, and but as means to an end.
“Self-evident,” some one may say; but in how many critics
have we found the fact acknowledged hitherto? and by how
many has it been frankly acknowledged since? That the aim
of the poet is to please, to satisfy the thirst for pleasure—that
is to say, to interest—all but the extremest ethical prudery will
admit. But critics, especially classical and neo-classical critics,
have always been in the mood of Christophero Sly when he
railed at the woman of the house and threatened her with presentation
at the leet,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Because she brought stone jugs and no sealed quarts.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Without the “sealed quart” of the Unity—of the Rule generally—these
critics will not slake, nor let others slake, their thirst.
But the affirmation of the Unity of Interest, in La Motte’s way,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_509'>509</span>does inevitably bring with it licence to use the stone jug or anything
else, so only that the good wine of poetry be made to do
its good office.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Quarrel left its traces for a long time on criticism, and
seems to have partly determined the composition, as late as
1730, of two books of some note, the <span lang="fr"><cite>Traité des
Études</cite></span> of the excellent Rollin, and the elaborate
<span lang="fr"><cite>Théâtre des Grecs</cite></span> of the Père Brumoy. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Rollin.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Of neither need we
say very much. The first-named<a id='r661'></a><a href='#f661' class='c019'><sup>[661]</sup></a> had considerable influence
at home and abroad, especially in Germany; but Rollin’s successor,
Batteux, was justified in the good-humoured malice of
his observation,<a id='r662'></a><a href='#f662' class='c019'><sup>[662]</sup></a> “<span lang="fr">Je trouve à l’article de la Poésie un discours
fort sensé sur son origine et sa destination, qui doit être toute
au profit de la vertu. On y cite les beaux endroits d’Homère;
on y donne la plus juste idée de la sublime Poésie des Livres
Saints; mais c'était une définition que je demandais.</span>” Alas! we
have experienced the same disappointment many times; nor is
it Batteux himself who will cure us of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Brumoy’s imposing quartos<a id='r663'></a><a href='#f663' class='c019'><sup>[663]</sup></a> have at least the advantage (how
great a one the same experience has shown us) of tackling a
definite subject in a business-like way. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Brumoy.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> His book
consists of actual translations of a certain number
of Greek pieces, of analyses of all the rest that we have, and of
divers discourses. He leads off with a forcible and well-founded
complaint of the extreme ignorance of Greek tragedy and drama
generally which the Quarrel had shown; his observations on
individual writers and pieces are often very sensible; and his
“Discourse on the Parallel between the Theatres” has a bearing
which he probably did not suspect, and might not have
relished. He dwells with vigour and knowledge on the <em>differences</em>
between them in order to show that not merely preference,
as in the Quarrel, but even strict comparison, is impossible between
things so different. It could not be but that sooner or
later it would dawn, on some readers at least, that it was even
more ridiculous to try to make the two obey the same laws.</p>

<p class='c000'>As has been already shown in the last book, literary criticism
<span class='pageno' id='Page_510'>510</span>had, even by the middle of the seventeenth century, established
so firm a hold on French taste that the representative system
becomes more and more imperative upon the historian thereof.
To represent the later days of Fontenelle and those when Voltaire,
though attaining, had not entirely attained his almost
European dictatorship of letters, three names will serve very
well; one perhaps new to many (if there be many) readers of
these pages, another one of the conscript names of literary
history, respected if not read, and the third a classic of the
world—in plainer words, Rémond de Saint-Mard, the Abbé Du
Bos, and Montesquieu.</p>

<p class='c000'>Saint-Mard has been rather badly treated by the books,—for
instance, Vapereau’s <span lang="fr"><cite>Dictionnaire des Littératures</cite></span>, often no
despicable compilation, not only dismisses him as
<span lang="fr"><i>médiocre</i></span>, but misspells his name Saint-Mar<em>c</em>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Rémond de Saint-Mard.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He
had, however, some influence in his own day, especially on the
Germans;<a id='r664'></a><a href='#f664' class='c019'><sup>[664]</sup></a> and there is an extremely pretty little edition<a id='r665'></a><a href='#f665' class='c019'><sup>[665]</sup></a> of
his works, most of which had been issued separately earlier. To
some extent he is a follower of Fontenelle, writes <cite>Dialogues of
Gods</cite>, &#38;c., <span lang="fr"><cite>Lettres Galantes et Philosophiques</cite></span>, and the like, to
please the town and the ladies, but with a constant turning to
criticism. In the “Discourse,” which precedes his <cite>Dialogues</cite> in
the collected edition, there is a very odd and, as it seems to me,
a very noteworthy passage, in which, though there may be some
would-be fine-gentleman nonchalance, there is also a dawning
of that sense of the unnaturalness and inconvenience of “the
rules” which is constantly showing itself in the early eighteenth
century. He admits<a id='r666'></a><a href='#f666' class='c019'><sup>[666]</sup></a> that he has not followed his own rules;
for the orthodox dialogue ought to have one subject, led up to
for some time, announced at last. But somehow or other most
of his dialogues have more. So few ideas are fertile enough for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_511'>511</span>a whole Dialogue!—a sentence which obviously cuts away the
theory of the rule, and not merely its practice.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor are his other works by any means destitute of original
ideas worthily put. In one of his definition-descriptions of
poetry,<a id='r667'></a><a href='#f667' class='c019'><sup>[667]</sup></a> if there is something of eighteenth-century sensualism,
there is much also of the acute and practical psychology of the
period. <span class='sni side4'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>L. Racine.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>The words <em>do</em> account—whether in “low” or “high”
fashion—for the poetic delight, as “Philosophy teaching by
example” and other arid abstractions do not. His theory elsewhere,
that Custom communicates the charm of versification
(he does not quote <span lang="la"><i>usus concinnat</i></span>, but inevitably suggests it),
has probably a great deal of truth in it, if it is not the whole
truth; and though we know that his explanation of the origin
of Poetry—that it came because Prose was too common—is
historically inaccurate, it is evidently only a false deduction,
uncorrected by actual historic knowledge, from the real fact that
the “discommoning of the common” <em>is</em> a main source of the
poetic pleasure. In points such as these Rémond de Saint-Mard
rises commendably above the estimable dulness of his
contemporary Louis Racine,<a id='r668'></a><a href='#f668' class='c019'><sup>[668]</sup></a> with his admiration
oddly distributed between Milton and his own papa,
and in the former case more oddly conditioned by respect for
Addison and Voltaire; his laborious rearrangement of most of
the old commonplaces about poetry and poets; and his obliging
explanation that “<span lang="fr">Ces images de magiciennes et de sorcières de
Laponie ne paraissaient pas extravagantes aux Anglais dans le
temps que Milton écrivit.</span>”</p>

<p class='c000'>By this time “Æsthetics” were breaking the shell everywhere;
but in many cases, as we have seen, they
did not consciously affect the critical principles of
writers. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Du Bos.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Du Bos, a solid inquirer, and a man of considerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_512'>512</span>ability in that striking out of wide generalisations which delighted
his time, could hardly have avoided them. His <span lang="fr"><cite>Réflexions
Critiques sur la Poésie et sur la Peinture</cite></span><a id='r669'></a><a href='#f669' class='c019'><sup>[669]</sup></a> have sometimes
been credited with considerable precursorship on the
literary side. It is certain that he lays some stress (Part
II., § 14 <i>sq.</i>) on the effect of Climate upon Art, and if this
“seem such dear delight, Beyond all other,” he must have
the credit due therefor from those to whom it so seems. To
those who reflect on the climatic authorship, say of <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite>
and the sonnets of La Casa, doubts may occur. Du
Bos is certainly an interesting and stimulating writer; but
his very excursions into generality seem to have precluded
him from studying any particular author carefully; and the
crotchet and paradox which appear in his more famous and
later <span lang="fr"><cite>Histoire de la Monarchie Française</cite></span> are not absent from
the <span lang="fr"><cite>Réflexions</cite></span>. These take, moreover, a distinctly “classic”
bent. Dr Johnson would have loved, and very possibly did
love, him for arguing in a masterly manner that French poetry
simply <em>cannot</em> equal Latin, either in style or in cadence and
harmony of verse; nor perhaps would Mr Matthew Arnold on
this occasion have disdained to say ditto to Dr Johnson. Latin
words are more beautiful than French. Harmony is easier to
attain in Latin than in French. The rules are less troublesome
in Latin than in French, and their observance results in
more beauties in the mother than in the daughter. This is
“Thorough” with a vengeance.<a id='r670'></a><a href='#f670' class='c019'><sup>[670]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>On the great question of <i>katharsis</i> Du Bos holds the view
that art operates by imitating the things which would have excited
strong passions in us if real, but which, as not
being real, only excite weak ones; and makes fair
fight for it (Part I., § 3). <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Stimulating but desultory character of his</i> Réflexions.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He thinks that while execution
is everything in painting it is not everything
in poetry, but still much. He quotes English critics, especially
Addison, pretty freely, and is not far from holding with them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_513'>513</span>that French drama deals too much with love. He has some
really acute remarks on what he calls poetry of style, distinguishing
this style from mere diction and versification, and
connecting this directly with his Latin-French paradox. He
even ventures close to the sin unpardonable, in the eyes of
Classicism, by arguing that the beauty of the parts of a poem
contributes more to its effect than the justness and regularity of
the plan, and that a poem may be “regular” to the <i>n</i><sup>th</sup> and yet
quite a bad poem. He has respect for the popular judgment—a
respect suggesting a not impossible acquaintance with
Gravina (<i>v. infra</i>, p. 538), who had written a good many years
before him: and he distinctly postulates, after the manner
of the century, an Æsthetic Sense existing in almost all, and
capable of deciding on points of taste (Part II., § 22). He has
some direct and more indirect observations in reference to the
Quarrel, speaking with trenchant, but not too trenchant, disapproval
(Part II., § 36) of those who endeavour to judge works
of art by translations and criticisms. On the main question
he is pretty sound. He is good on genius, and on what he
calls the <em>artisan</em>, the craftsman <em>without</em> genius. Taking him
altogether, Du Bos may be allowed the praise of a really fertile
and original writer,<a id='r671'></a><a href='#f671' class='c019'><sup>[671]</sup></a> who says many things which are well
worth attention and which seldom received it before him, in
regard to what may be called the previous questions of criticism.
His connection of poetry with painting sometimes helps
him, and seldom leads him absolutely wrong; but it to some
extent distracts him, and constantly gives an air of desultoriness
and haphazard to his observation. It is, moreover, quite
remarkable how persistently he abides <span lang="la"><i>in generalibus</i></span>, scarcely
ever descending below the mediate examination of Kinds.
When he touches on individual works of art he confines himself
in the most gingerly fashion to illustration merely; there
is never an appreciation in whole or in considerable part.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Voltaire denounced Montesquieu for <span lang="fr"><cite>lèse-poésie</cite></span>, the
accused, if he had chosen, might have brought formidable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_514'>514</span>counter accusations; but there was certainly some ground for
the actual charge. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Montesquieu.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> When a man says<a id='r672'></a><a href='#f672' class='c019'><sup>[672]</sup></a> that “the
four great poets are Plato, Malebranche, Shaftesbury,
and Montaigne,” he is evidently either a heretic or a
paradoxer; and the hundred and thirty-seventh of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Lettres
Persanes</cite></span> gives a sad colour to the worse supposition. There
is perhaps less actual high treason to poetry here than in the
remarks of Signor Pococurante, that noble Venetian, but there
is more intended; the whole treatment is ostentatiously contemptuous.
Dramatists are allowed some merit, but poets in
general “put good sense in irons, and smother reason in
ornament.” As for epic poems, connoisseurs themselves say
that there never have been but two good ones, and never
will be a third.<a id='r673'></a><a href='#f673' class='c019'><sup>[673]</sup></a> Lyric poets are contemptible creatures who
deal in nothing but harmonious extravagance and so forth. As
for romances in prose, they have the faults of poems and others
to boot. Elsewhere, in Letter xlviii., a “poet is the grotesque
of the human race.” It is scarcely surprising that, when we
turn to the <span lang="fr"><cite>Essai sur le Goût</cite></span>, there is hardly any definite
reference to literature at all, and that Montesquieu is entirely
occupied in tracing or imagining abstract reasons for the
attractiveness of abstract things like “surprise,” “symmetry,”
“variety,” and even of the <span lang="fr"><i>je ne sais quoi</i></span>. The <span lang="fr"><i>je ne sais
quoi</i></span> in an attractive, but not technically beautiful, girl is, it
seems, due to surprise at finding her so attractive, which, with
all respect to the President, seems to be somewhat “circular.”
In fact, Montesquieu is chiefly interesting to us, first, because
he made no literary use of his own theories as to climate and
the rest—which later writers have used and abused in this
way; and secondly, because he shows, <span lang="la"><i>in excelsis</i></span>, that radically
unliterary as well as unpoetical vein which, for all its remarkable
literary performance, is characteristic of his time.</p>

<p class='c000'>It will surprise no one who has any acquaintance with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_515'>515</span>subject that but a few lines should have been given to
Montesquieu; it may shock some to find but a
very few pages given to Voltaire.<a id='r674'></a><a href='#f674' class='c019'><sup>[674]</sup></a> <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Voltaire: Disappointments of his criticism.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But while I
have never been able to rank the Patriarch’s criticism
high, a reperusal of it in sequence, for the
purpose of this book, has even reduced the level of my
estimate. The fact is that, consummate literary craftsman as
he was, and wanting only the <span lang="fr"><i>je ne sais quoi</i></span> itself (or rather
something that we know too well) to rank with the very
greatest men of letters, Voltaire was not a man with whom
literary interest by any means predominated. It is not merely
that his anti-crusade against <span lang="fr"><i>l’infâme</i></span> constantly colours his
literary, as it does all his other, judgments; and that once at
least it made him certainly indorse, and possibly enounce, the
astounding statement that the Parables in the Gospels are
“coarse and low.”<a id='r675'></a><a href='#f675' class='c019'><sup>[675]</sup></a> But when this perpetually disturbing
influence is at its least active point, we can see perfectly
that neither Voltaire’s treasure nor his heart is anywhere, with
the doubtful exception of the drama division, in literature. In
mathematics and in physical science there is no doubt that he
was genuinely interested; and he was perhaps still more interested
(as indeed men of his century generally were) in what
may be vaguely called anthropology, the moral, social, and (to
some, though only to some, extent) political history of mankind.
But for literature he had very little genuine love; though the
vanity in which he certainly was not lacking could not fail to
be conscious of his own excellence as a practitioner in it; and
though he could not but recognise its power—its almost
omnipotence—as a weapon. It was probably the more human
character of the drama that attracted him there.</p>

<p class='c000'>However this may be, it is impossible, for me at least, to rank
him high as a critic: and this refusal is hardly in the
least due to his famous blasphemies against Shakespeare
and Milton. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Examples of it.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> As we have seen—as we shall see—it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_516'>516</span>possible to disagree profoundly with some, nay, with many, of a
critic’s estimates, and yet to think highly of his critical gifts.
But Voltaire scarcely anywhere shows the true <span lang="la"><i>ethos</i></span> of the critic:
and that “smattering erudition” of his is nowhere so much of a
smattering, and so little of an erudition, as here. His two
famous surveys of English and French literature, in the <span lang="fr"><cite>Lettres
sur les Anglais</cite></span> and the <span lang="fr"><cite>Siècle de Louis Quatorze</cite></span>, show, on the
French side at least, a more complete ignorance of literary
history than Boileau’s own: and the individual judgments,
though admirably expressed, are banal and without freshness of
grasp. The extensive <cite>Commentary on Corneille</cite> contains, of
course, interesting things, but is of no high critical value. The
<span lang="fr"><cite>Essai sur la Poésie <a id='corr516.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Epique'>Épique</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_516.13'><ins class='correction' title='Epique'>Épique</ins></a></span></cite></span> opens with some excellent ridicule of
“the rules”—a subject which indeed might seem to invite the
Voltairian method irresistibly; but after this and some serious
good sense of the same kind, he practically deserts to the rules
themselves. He admits <span lang="fr"><i>fautes grossières</i></span> in Homer, finds “monstrosity
and absurdity up to the limits of imagination” in Shakespeare,
thinks that Virgil is “Homer’s best work,” discovers
in the supernatural of Tasso and Camoens only “insipid stories
fit to amuse children,” dismisses, as everybody knows, the great
Miltonic episode of Satan, Death, and Sin as “disgusting and
abominable,” and keeps up throughout his survey that wearisome
castanet-clatter of “fault and beauty—beauty and fault”
which, whensoever and wheresoever we find it, simply means
that the critic is not able to see his subject as a whole, and
tell us whether it is foul or fair.</p>

<p class='c000'>Perhaps no better instance of the feebleness of Voltaire’s
criticism can be found than in his dealings with Rabelais.<a id='r676'></a><a href='#f676' class='c019'><sup>[676]</sup></a>
Here there are practically no disturbing elements. Yet no one
is more responsible than Voltaire is for the common notion,
equally facile and false, of Rabelais as a freethinker with
a sharp eye to the main chance, who disguised his freethinking in
a cloak of popular obscenity, who is often amusing, sometimes
admirable, but as a whole coarse, tedious, and illegible, or at best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_517'>517</span>appealing to the most vulgar taste. Take the famous sentence
that Swift is a “<span lang="fr">Rabelais de bonne compagnie,</span>”<a id='r677'></a><a href='#f677' class='c019'><sup>[677]</sup></a> work it out
either side, and it will be difficult to find anywhere words more
radically uncritical. Or turn to the <span lang="fr"><cite>Dictionnaire Philosophique</cite></span>.
Not only are the literary articles very few, and in some of these
few cases mere <span lang="fr"><i>rechauffés</i></span> of the <span lang="fr"><cite>Lettres sur Les Anglais</cite></span>, &#38;c., but
the head “Literature” itself contains the singular statement that
criticism is <em>not</em> literature—because nobody speaks of “<span lang="fr">une belle
critique.</span>” The articles “<span lang="fr">Esprit</span>” and “<span lang="fr">Goût</span>” are attractive—especially
the latter, because it is on the critical watchword of
the century: but we are sent away, worse than empty, with some
abuse of Shakespeare, and with the statement, “No man of letters
can possibly fail to recognise the <em>perfected</em> taste of Boileau in the
<span lang="fr"><cite>Art Poétique</cite></span>.” Only, perhaps, the article on <span lang="fr"><cite>Art Dramatique</cite></span> is
worthy of its title, and the reason of this has been indicated.</p>

<p class='c000'>The numerous <span lang="fr"><cite>Mélanges Littéraires</cite></span> are again interesting reading—indeed,
when is Voltaire <em>not</em> interesting, save when he is
scientific, or when he shows that “the zeal of the <em>devil’s</em> house”
can inspire a man of genius with forty-curate-power dulness?
They include almost every kind of writing, from actual reviews
(<span lang="fr"><cite>Lettres aux Auteurs de La Gazette Littéraire</cite></span>) on books French
and foreign, upwards or downwards. But all those that are
probably genuine exhibit just the same characteristics as the more
elaborate works. The reviews of Sterne and of Churchill will
show how really superficial Voltaire’s literary grip was; though
both of them (as being Voltaire’s they could not well help
doing) contain acute remarks. The too famous argument-abstract
of <cite>Hamlet</cite><a id='r678'></a><a href='#f678' class='c019'><sup>[678]</sup></a> is perhaps the most remarkable example of
irony exploding through the touch-hole that literature affords.
The “Parallel of Horace, Boileau, and Pope” from such a hand
might seem as if it could not be without value: but it has very
little. And perhaps nowhere does Voltaire appear to much less
critical advantage than in the <span lang="fr"><cite>Lettre de M. de La Visclède</cite></span> on La
Fontaine, where, as in the case of Rabelais, it might be thought
that no prejudice could possibly affect him. The superfine condemnation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_518'>518</span>of the <span lang="fr"><i>bonhomme’s</i></span> style, as filled with expressions
<span lang="fr"><i>plus faites pour le peuple que pour les honnêtes gens</i></span> (not, let it be
observed, in the <cite>Fables</cite>, but in the <span lang="fr"><cite>Contes</cite></span>), could hardly tell a
more disastrous tale. Philistia by its Goliath in Paris echoes
Philistia by its common folk in London, at this special time.
La Fontaine and Goldsmith are “low.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The fact would appear to be that, independently of that lack
of purely literary interest which has been noted above, other
causes kept Voltaire back from really original and
valuable criticism. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Causes of his failure.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The sense of the necessity of
clinging to and conserving <em>something</em>, which has often been
shown by iconoclasts, seems to have directed itself in him
towards literary orthodoxy: while, on the other hand, as we
have already seen, his natural acuteness refused to blink entirely
some of the absurdities of the “Rule” system. His craftsmanship
made it possible for him to succeed in certain kinds of
artificial poetry—the regular tragedy, the formal heroic poem,
the light piece, epigram, or epistle, or what not—which were
specially favoured by Classical criticism. He was not well
equipped by nature for success in any Romantic kind—not to
mention that Romance was almost indissolubly connected with
those Ages of Faith which he scorned. Moreover, though no
man has committed more faults of taste, in the wider and nobler
sense, than did Voltaire, yet within a narrower and more
arbitrary circle of “taste” of the conventional kind, no one
could walk with more unerring precision. Yet again, the Great
Assumption by which the neo-classics made a changeling of their
Taste with Good Sense, and mothered it on Nature, appealed
strongly to such philosophical theories as he had. Accordingly,
both in public and private,<a id='r679'></a><a href='#f679' class='c019'><sup>[679]</sup></a> the great heretic, with very few
exceptions, plays the part of a very Doctor of the Literary
Sorbonne, and leaves the attempt at a new criticism to the more
audacious innovation, and the more thorough-going naturalism,
of Diderot.<a id='r680'></a><a href='#f680' class='c019'><sup>[680]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_519'>519</span>Of the other <span lang="fr"><i>Di majores</i></span> of the <span lang="fr"><i>philosophe</i></span> school, Rousseau
would always have been prevented by his temperament from
expressing critically the appreciations which the
same temperament might have suggested: and, if
he had been a critic at all, he would have been on the revolting
and Romantic side. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Others: Buffon.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Diderot actually was so. The critical
utterances of D’Alembert,<a id='r681'></a><a href='#f681' class='c019'><sup>[681]</sup></a> chiefly if not wholly given in his
<span lang="fr"><cite>Éloges</cite></span>, express the clear understanding and by no means trivial
good sense of their writer. But, like Voltaire’s, D’Alembert’s
heart was elsewhere. Buffon remains; and by a curious
accident he, though <span lang="la"><i>totus in</i></span> the things of mere science, has
left us one of the most noteworthy phrases of literary
criticism in the history of literature. Moreover, this phrase is
contained in a discourse<a id='r682'></a><a href='#f682' class='c019'><sup>[682]</sup></a> which is all literary and almost all
critical, which is very admirable within its own range and
on its own side, and which practically provides us with one
of the first, and to this day one of the best, discussions of
Style as such. That we have in these latter days “heard too
much of Style” is often said, and may be true: “where” we
have <em>seen</em> too much of it “you shall tell me” as Seithenin said
to the Prince. But we, in the restricted sense of students of
criticism, have not “seen too much” of discussions of style
hitherto. On the contrary, we have seen that the ancients
were constantly shy of it in its quiddity; that even Longinus
seems to prefer to abstract and embody one of its qualities and
discuss that; and that after the revival of criticism the old
avoidances, or the old apologies for the <i>phortikon ti</i>, were too
often renewed. Buffon has none of this prudery: though
he lays the greatest possible stress on the necessity of there
being something behind style, of style being “the burin that
graves the thought.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_520'>520</span>Perhaps he does not quite keep at the height of his famous
and often misquoted<a id='r683'></a><a href='#f683' class='c019'><sup>[683]</sup></a> dictum—“<span lang="fr">Le style est l’homme même</span>”—in
itself the best thing ever said on the subject,
and, as is the case with most good things, made
better by the context. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>“<i>Style and the man.</i>”<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He has been showing why only well-written
books go down to posterity. Information can be
transferred; fact becomes public property; novelty ceases to
be novel. <span lang="fr"><i>Ces choses sont hors de l’homme; le style est</i> [<i>de</i>?]
<i>l’homme même.</i></span> In other words, the style—the form—is
that which the author adds to the matter; it is that inseparable,
but separably intelligible, element which cannot be transferred,
taken away, or lost. It is clear that Buffon would not
have lent himself to that discountenancing of the distinction of
Matter and Form which some have attempted. Perhaps his
other remarks are less uniformly, though they are often, admirable.
He should not, as a man of natural science, have
congratulated the Academicians on contemning “<span lang="fr">le vain son des
mots,</span>” which, he should have known, always has something,
and may have much, to do with style; and it is certainly inadequate
to say that style is “the <em>order and movement</em> given to
our thoughts.” There is much that is true, but also something
of mere neo-classic orthodoxy, in his painful repetitions of the
necessity of unity and greatness of subject; and to say that
“<span lang="fr">l’esprit humain ne peut rien créer</span>” is sheer <span lang="fr"><i>lèse-littérature</i></span>.
Rather is it true that, except God, the human mind is the only
thing that can create, and that it shows its divine origin
thereby. But Buffon was only a man of science, and we must
excuse him. The special curse of the time<a id='r684'></a><a href='#f684' class='c019'><sup>[684]</sup></a> is curiously
visible in his enumeration, among the causes of nobility in
style, of “<span lang="fr">L’attention à ne nommer les choses que par <span lang="fr"><i>les termes
les plus généraux</i></span>.</span>” The “streak of the tulip” barred again!
But he is certainly right when he says that “<span lang="fr">jamais l’imitation
n’a rien créé</span>”: though here it may be retorted, “Yes; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_521'>521</span>imitation teaches how to discard itself, and to begin to create,”
while, as he has just extended the disability to the human
faculties generally, his point seems a blunt one. Still, his
directions for <span lang="fr"><i>ordonnance</i></span> as a preliminary to style, his cautions
against <span lang="fr"><i>pointes</i></span>, <span lang="fr"><i>traits saillants</i></span>, pomposity [he might have recked
this rede a little more himself], and other things, are excellent.
The piece is extraordinary in its combination of originality,
brilliancy, and sense, and in it Science has certainly lent
Literature one of the best critical essays of the eighteenth
century.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not an unimportant document of the time for the history of
criticism is the critical attitude of that remarkable Marcellus
of philosophism, Vauvenargues.<a id='r685'></a><a href='#f685' class='c019'><sup>[685]</sup></a> The few <span lang="fr"><cite>Réflexions Critiques</cite></span>
which he has left are very curious. Vauvenargues was a man
of an absolute independence of spirit so far as he knew; but
conditioned by the limits of his knowledge. He had neither
time nor opportunity for much reading; he probably knew little
of any literature but his own. It must be remembered also
that his main bent was ethical, not literary. Such a man should
give us the form and pressure of the time in an unusual and
interesting way.</p>

<p class='c000'>Vauvenargues does so. We find him, after a glowing and
almost adequate eulogy of La Fontaine, gibbeting him for
showing <span lang="fr"><i>plus de style que d’invention, et plus de négligence
que d’exactitude</i></span>—not the happiest pair of
antitheses. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Vauvenargues.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The subjects of his <cite>Tales</cite> are “low”—unfortunate
word which “speaks” almost every one who uses it—and they
are not interesting, which is more surprising. Boileau, on the
contrary, is extolled to the skies. He has really too much
genius (like the 'Badian who was really too brave), and this
excess, with a smaller excess of fire, truth, solidity, <span lang="fr"><i>agrément</i></span>,
may have perhaps injured his range, depth, height, finesse, and
grace. Molière again is <span lang="fr"><i>trop bas</i></span> (at least his subjects are),
while La Bruyère escapes this defect—you might as well set
<span class='pageno' id='Page_522'>522</span>together Addison and Shakespeare, and no doubt Vauvenargues
would have done so. How different is Racine, who is always
“great”—“gallantly great,” let us add, like Mr Pepys in his
new suit. Voltaire, who had certainly prompted some of these
sins, made a little atonement by inducing Vauvenargues to
admire Corneille to some extent. But Corneille, he says, from
his date, <em>could</em> not have <span lang="fr"><i>le goût juste</i></span>, and the parallel with
Racine is one of the most interesting of its numerous kind.
J. B. Rousseau might have been nearly as good a poet as
Boileau, if Boileau had not taught him all he knew in poetry,
but his <span lang="fr"><i>vieux langage</i></span> is most regrettable. Such were the
opinions of a young man of unusual ability, but with little
taste in literature except that which he found prevalent in
the middle of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p class='c000'>This middle, and the later part of it, saw in the Abbé Batteux
the last of that really remarkable, though not wholly estimable,
line of <span lang="fr"><i>législateurs du Parnasse</i></span> which had begun
with Boileau, and whose edicts had been accepted,
for the best part of a century, with almost universal deference.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Batteux.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Still later, and surviving into the confines of the nineteenth
century, La Harpe gives us almost the last distinguished defender,
and certainly a defender as uncompromising as he was
able, of neo-classic orthodoxy. Some attention must be given
to each of these, and to Marmontel between them, but we need
not say very much of others—except in the representative
way.</p>

<p class='c000'>Batteux began as an extoller of the <cite>Henriade</cite>, after many
years spent in schoolmastering and the occasional publication
of Latin verses, but before the century had reached the middle
of its road. He essayed, a little later, divers treatises<a id='r686'></a><a href='#f686' class='c019'><sup>[686]</sup></a> on Poetic
and Rhetoric, all of which were adjusted and collected in his
<span lang="fr"><cite>Principes de la Littérature</cite></span>,<a id='r687'></a><a href='#f687' class='c019'><sup>[687]</sup></a> while he also executed various
minor works, the most useful of which was <span lang="fr"><cite>Les Quatre Poétiques</cite></span>,<a id='r688'></a><a href='#f688' class='c019'><sup>[688]</sup></a>
a translation, with critical notes, of Aristotle, Horace, and Vida,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_523'>523</span>with Boileau added. In so far as I am able to judge, Batteux
is about the best of the seventeenth-eighteenth century “Preceptists.”<a id='r689'></a><a href='#f689' class='c019'><sup>[689]</sup></a>
The Introduction to his introductory tractate, <span lang="fr"><cite>Les
Beaux Arts réduits à un même Principe</cite></span>, indulges in some mild
but by no means unbecoming irony on his predecessors,<a id='r690'></a><a href='#f690' class='c019'><sup>[690]</sup></a> and
expresses the candid opinion that few of them had really consulted
Aristotle at all. He admits the multiplicity and the
galling character of “rules”; but he thinks that these can be
reduced to a tolerable and innoxious, nay, in the highest degree
useful, minimum, by keeping the eye fixed on the Imitation of
Nature, and of the best nature. But how is this to guide us?
Here Batteux shows real ingenuity by seizing on the other
great fetich of the eighteenth-century creed—Taste—as a regulator
to be in its turn regulated.</p>

<p class='c000'>Indeed a careful perusal of Batteux cannot but force on us
the consideration that the mechanical age, the age of Arkwright
and Watt, was approaching, or had approached.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His adjustment of Rules and Taste.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> His Rules and his Taste “clutch” each other by
turns, like the elaborate plant of the modern machinist.
If the Rules are too narrow and precise,
Taste holds them open; if Taste shows any sign of getting lawless,
the Rules bring it to its bearings. It is extremely ingenious;
but the questions remain—Whether it is natural? and
Whether any good came from the exercise of the principles
which it attempts to reconcile and defend? The manner of
Batteux, it must be allowed, is as much less freezing and unsatisfactory
than Le Bossu’s, as it is less arbitrary and less aggressive
than Boileau’s. These two would, in the face of fact and
history, have <em>identified</em> Taste and a certain construction of Rule.
Batteux rather regards the two as reciprocal escapements, easing
and regulating each other. It is part of his merit that he recognises,
to some extent, the importance of observation. In fact,
great part of this introductory treatise is a naïf and interesting
complaint of the difficulty which the results of this observation
are introducing into Rule-criticism. “Rules are getting
so many,” he admits in his opening sentence; and, no doubt, so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_524'>524</span>long as you find it necessary to make a new rule whenever you
find a new poet, the state of things must be more and more
parlous. But, like all his century-fellows without exception on
the Classical, and like too many on the other side, he does not
think of simply marching through the open door, and leaving
the prison of Rule and Kind behind him.</p>

<p class='c000'>From these idols Batteux will not yet be separated: he hardens
his heart in a different manner from Pharaoh, and will
not let himself go. The <span lang="la"><i>utile</i></span> is never to be parted from the
<span lang="la"><i>dulce</i></span>; “the poems of Homer and Virgil are not vain Romances,
where the mind wanders at the will of a mad imagination; they
are great bodies of doctrine,” &#38;c. Anacreon [Heaven help us!]
was himself determined to be a moral teacher.<a id='r691'></a><a href='#f691' class='c019'><sup>[691]</sup></a> Again, there
must be Action, and it must be single, united, simple, yet of
variety; the style must not be too low, or too high, &#38;c., &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Batteux has got into the old rut, he remains in it.
We slip into the well-known treatises by Kinds—Dialogue,
Eclogue, Heroic Poem, and the rest—with the equally well-known
examination afterwards of celebrated examples in a
shamefaced kind of way—to the extent of two whole volumes
for poetry, and a third (actually the fourth) for prose. Finally,
we have what is really a separate tractate, <span lang="fr"><cite>De la Construction
Oratoire</cite></span>. The details in these later volumes are often excellent;
but obviously, and <span lang="la"><i>per se</i></span>, they fall into quite a lower
rank as compared with the first. If we were to look at nothing
but the fact, frankly acknowledged by Batteux, that he is now
considering French classical literature only, we should be able
to detect the error. In his first volume he had at least referred
to Milton.</p>

<p class='c000'>In other words Batteux, like the rest of them, is not so much
a halter between two opinions as a man who has deliberately
made up his mind to abide by one, but who will
let in as much of the other as he thinks it safe to
do, or cannot help doing. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His incompleteness.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
 Let him once extend his principle of
observation in time, country, and kind, and, being a reasonably
ingenious and ingenuous person, he must discover, first, that his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_525'>525</span>elaborate double-check system of Rule and Taste will not work,
and, secondly, that there is not the least need of it. You must
charge epicycle on cycle before you can get, even with the freest
play of Taste, the <cite>Iliad</cite> and the <cite>Æneid</cite> and the <cite>Orlando</cite> to
work together under any Rule. Epicycle must be added to epicycle
before you can get in the <span lang="fr"><cite>Chanson de Roland</cite></span> and the
<span lang="fr"><cite>Morte d’Arthur</cite></span> as well. Drop your “rule,” ask simply, “Are
the things put before me said <span lang="fr"><i>poeticamente</i></span>?” “Do they give
me the poetic pleasure?” and there is no further difficulty.
Batteux, though, as we have seen, by no means a bigot, would
probably have stopped his ears and rent his clothes if such
a suggestion had been made to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Batteux is a remarkable, and probably the latest, example of
neo-classicism sitting at ease in Zion and promulgating laws
for submissive nations; in La Harpe, with an
even stronger dogmatism, we shall find, if not the
full consciousness that the enemy is at the gates of the capital,
at any rate distinct evidence of knowledge that there is
sedition in the provinces.<a id='r692'></a><a href='#f692' class='c019'><sup>[692]</sup></a> <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Marmontel.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Between the two, Marmontel<a id='r693'></a><a href='#f693' class='c019'><sup>[693]</sup></a> is
a distinguished, and a not disagreeable, example of that middle
state which we find everywhere in the late eighteenth century
but which in France is distinguished at once by greater professed
orthodoxy, and by concessions and compromises of a specially
tell-tale kind. The critical work of the author of <span lang="fr"><cite>Bélisaire</cite></span>
and <span lang="fr"><cite>Les Incas</cite></span> is very considerable in bulk. He has written an
Essay on Romance in connection with the two very “anodyne”
examples of the kind just referred to; an Essay (indeed two
essays) on Taste; many book reviews for the <span lang="fr"><cite>Observateur Littéraire</cite></span>,
&#38;c.; prefaces and comments for some specimens of
French early seventeenth-century drama—Mairet’s <span lang="fr"><cite>Sophonisbe</cite></span>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_526'>526</span>Du Ryer’s <span lang="fr"><cite>Scévole</cite></span>, &#38;c.; and, besides other things, a mass of articles
on literary and critical subjects for the <span lang="fr"><cite>Encyclopédie</cite></span>, which are
generally known in their collected form as <span lang="fr"><cite><a id='corr526.3'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Eléments'>Éléments</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_526.3'><ins class='correction' title='Eléments'>Éléments</ins></a></span> de Littérature</cite></span>.
He has been rather variously judged as a critic.
There is no doubt that he is a special sinner in that perpetual
gabble about <span lang="fr"><i>la vertu, la morale</i></span>, and the rest, which is so sickening
in the whole group; and which more than justified Mr
Carlyle’s vigorous apostrophe, “<em>Be</em> virtuous, in the Devil’s
name and his grandmother’s, and have done with it!” He
has also that apparent inconsistency, something of which (as
we have seen once for all in Dryden’s case) often shows itself
in men of alert literary interests who do not very early work
out for themselves a personal literary creed, and who are averse
to swallowing a ready-made one. But at the same time he
never openly quarrels with neo-classicism, and is sometimes
one of its most egregious spokesmen; while he is “philosophastrous,”
in the special eighteenth-century kind, to a point
which closely approaches caricature. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Oddities and qualities of his criticism.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> I have quoted
elsewhere, but must necessarily quote again here,
his three egregious and pyramidal reasons<a id='r694'></a><a href='#f694' class='c019'><sup>[694]</sup></a> for the
puzzling excellence of English poetry. Either, it
seems, the Englishman, being a glory-loving animal, sees that
poetry adds to the lustre of nations, and so he goes and does
it; <em>or</em> being naturally given to meditation and sadness, he needs
to be moved and distracted by the illusions of this beautiful
art; <em>or</em> [Shade of Molière!] it is because his genius in certain
respects is proper for Poesy.</p>

<p class='c000'>To comment on this would only spoil it; but let it be observed
that Marmontel <em>does</em> admit the excellence of English poetry. So
also, though he never swerves, in consciousness or conscience, from
neo-classic orthodoxy, he insinuates certain doubts about Boileau,
and quotes,<a id='r695'></a><a href='#f695' class='c019'><sup>[695]</sup></a> at full length, two pieces of the despised Ronsard as
showing lyrical qualities in which the legislator of Parnassus
is wanting. His article <span lang="fr"><cite>Poétique</cite></span> is, considering his standpoint,
a quite extraordinarily just summary and criticism of the most
celebrated authorities on the subject—Aristotle, Horace, Vida,
Scaliger, Castelvetro, Vauquelin, Boileau, Le Bossu, Gravina, &#38;c.—and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_527'>527</span>the attitude to Boileau,<a id='r696'></a><a href='#f696' class='c019'><sup>[696]</sup></a> visible, as has been said, elsewhere,
is extremely noteworthy. Marmontel speaks of Despréaux
with compliments: but some, even of his praises, are not a little
equivocal, and he contrives to put his subject’s faults with
perfect politeness indeed, but without a vestige of compromise.
Boileau, he says, gives a precise and luminous notion of all the
kinds, but he is not deep on a single one: his <cite>Art</cite> may contribute
to form the taste if it be well understood, but to understand
it well one must have the taste already formed.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would be possible, of course,—indeed, very easy,—to select
from Marmontel’s abundant critical writings, which covered
great part of a long lifetime in their composition, a bundle of
“classical” absurdities which would leave nothing to desire.
But the critic is almost always better than his form of creed.
He takes an obviously genuine, if of necessity not at first a
thoroughly well instructed, interest in the <span lang="fr"><cite>Histoire du Théâtre</cite></span>
of the Frères Parfait, the first systematic<a id='r697'></a><a href='#f697' class='c019'><sup>[697]</sup></a> dealing with old
French literature since Fauchet and Pasquier: his <span lang="fr"><cite>Essai sur les
Romans</cite></span>, though of course considered <span lang="fr"><i>du côté moral</i></span>, is, for his
date, a noteworthy attempt in that comparative and historical
study of literature which was to lead to the new birth of criticism.
It is most remarkable to find him, in the early reviews of
his <span lang="fr"><cite>Observateur</cite></span>,<a id='r698'></a><a href='#f698' class='c019'><sup>[698]</sup></a> dating from the midst of the fifth decade of the
eighteenth century, observing, as to <cite>Hamlet</cite> in La Place’s translation,
that the ghost-scene and the duel with Laertes inspire
terror and pathetic interest at the very reading, asking why “our
poets” should deny themselves the use of these great springs of
the two tragic passions, admiring the taste and justice of
the observations to the players, and actually finding <cite>Titus
Andronicus</cite>, though “frightful and sanguinary,” a thing worth
serious study. That it is possible to extract from these very
places, as from others, the usual stuff about Shakespeare’s
“want of order and decency,” &#38;c., is of no moment. <em>This</em> is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_528'>528</span>matter of course: it is not matter of course that, in the dead
waist and middle of the eighteenth century, a French critic
should write of the description of Cleopatra on the Cydnus:
“<span lang="fr">Ce morceau présente Shakespeare sous un nouveau point de
vue. On n’a connu jusqu'à présent que la force du génie de
cet auteur: on ne s’attendait pas à tant de délicatesse et
de légèreté.</span>”<a id='r699'></a><a href='#f699' class='c019'><sup>[699]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>I should like to dwell longer on Marmontel if it were only for
two or three phrases which appear in one short article,<a id='r700'></a><a href='#f700' class='c019'><sup>[700]</sup></a> “<span lang="fr">Depuis
que Pascal et Corneille, Racine et Boileau ont <em>épuré et appauvri</em>
la langue de Marot et de Montaigne.... Boileau n’avait pas
reçu de la nature l’organe avec lequel on sent les beautés
simples et touchantes de notre divin fabuliste</span> [La Fontaine of
course].... <span lang="fr">Il est à souhaiter qu’on n’abandonne pas ce
langage du bon vieux temps ... on ferait un joli dictionnaire
des mots qu’on a tort d’abandonner et de laisser vieillir.</span>” It
must be clear to any one who reads these phrases that there is
the germ of <span lang="fr"><i>mil-huit-cent-trente</i></span> in them—the first and hardly
certain sound of the knell of narrow, colourless vocabulary and
literature in France. But enough has probably been said. It
would be difficult to make out a case for Marmontel as in any
way a great critic. He has not cleared his mind of cant enough
for that. But he is an instance, and an important instance, of the
way in which the clearing agents were being gradually thrown
into the minds of men of letters at this time, and of the reaction
which they were—at first partially and accidentally—producing.
Even his <span lang="fr"><cite>Essai sur le Goût</cite></span>, fantastically arbitrary
as it is, wears at times almost an air of irony, as if the writer
were really exposing the arbitrariness and the convention of the
thing he is ostensibly praising. He is comparing and tasting,
not simply deducing: and however much he may still be
inclined to think with his master that the Satan, Sin, and
Death piece is an unimaginable horror, and the citizen scenes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_529'>529</span>in Shakespeare’s Roman plays a vulgar excrescence, he is
far from the obstinate sublimity-in-absurdity of La Harpe.
He at least does not hold that a beauty, not according to
rule, has no business to be a beauty; that the tree is not
to be judged by the fruit, but the fruit by the ticket on
the tree.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the <span lang="la"><i>mare magnum</i></span> of critical writing at this period, constantly
fed by books, literary periodicals, academic competitions,
and what not, it would be idle to attempt
to chronicle drops—individuals who are not in
some special way interesting or representative. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Others.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It would be
especially idle because—for reasons indicated more than once
in passing already—the bulk of the criticism of this time in
France is really of little value, being as doctrine make-believe,
and destitute of thoroughness, and as appreciation injured by
narrowness of reading and want of true literary interest. It
cannot have been quite accidental, although the great collaborative
<span lang="fr"><cite>Histoire de la Littérature Française</cite></span> of the late M. Petit de
Julleville is not a model of methodic adequacy, that there is no
strictly critical chapter in the volume on the eighteenth century.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Thomas, Suard, &#38;c.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Take, for instance, two such representative men as Suard and
Thomas, both of them born near the beginning of
the second generation of the century, and therefore
characteristic of its very central class and <span lang="fr"><i>crû</i></span>. Both enjoyed
almost the highest reputation in the second rank. Marmontel
somewhere speaks of Thomas’s <span lang="fr"><cite>Essai sur les Éloges</cite></span> as the best
piece of critical inquiry which had appeared since Cicero on the
Orator; but it is fair to remember that Thomas had refused to
stand against Marmontel for the Academy. Suard, for many
years Secretary of the Academy itself, seriously endeavoured,
and was by his contemporaries thought not to have endeavoured
in vain, to make that office a sort of Criticship Laureate or
King’s Remembrancership of Literature. He has left volumes
on volumes of critical work; and even now prefaces, introductions,
&#38;c., from his pen may be found in the older class of
standard editions of French classics. Yet the work of neither
of these would justify us in doing more than refer to them in
this fashion. It is excellently written in the current style, inclining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_530'>530</span>to declamation and solemnity in Thomas,<a id='r701'></a><a href='#f701' class='c019'><sup>[701]</sup></a> to <em>persiflage</em>
and smartness in Suard. It says what an academic critic of the
time was supposed to say, and knows what he was supposed to
know. But it really is, in Miss Mills’ excellent figure, “the
desert of Sahara,” and a desert without many, if any, oases.</p>

<p class='c000'>La Harpe is a different person. He is not very kind to
Batteux. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>La Harpe.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He patronises his principles, and allows his scholarship
to be sound; but finds fault with his style, calls
his criticism <span lang="la"><i>commune</i></span>—“lacking in distinction” is
perhaps the best equivalent—his ideas narrow, and his prejudices
pedantic. It would not be quite just to say <span lang="la"><i>De te fabula</i></span>, but this
is almost as much as we could say if we were judging La Harpe,
after his own fashion of judgment, from a different standpoint.
But the historian cannot judge thus. La Harpe is really an
important person in the History of Criticism. He “makes an
end,” as Mr Carlyle used to say; in other words, whether he
is or is not the last eminent neo-classical critic of France, he
puts this particular phase of criticism as sharply and as effectively
as it can be put. Nay, he does even more than this for
us; he shows us neo-classicism at bay. Already, by the time of
his later lectures, when by the oddest coincidence he was defending
Voltaire and abusing Diderot, making head at once
against the Jacobins and against that party of revived mediævalism
which was the surest antidote to Jacobinism, there were
persons—Népomucène Lemercier, and others—who held that
Boileau and Racine had killed French poetry. Against these
La Harpe takes up his testimony; and the necessity of opposition
makes it all the more decided.</p>

<p class='c000'>His <span lang="fr"><cite>Cours de Littérature</cite></span> is a formidable—I had almost called
it an impossible—book to tackle, composed of, or redacted from,
the lectures of many years, and unfortunately, though
not unnaturally, dwelling most fully on the parts
of the subject that are of least real importance. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His</i> <span lang="fr">Cours de Littérature.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Its first
edition<a id='r702'></a><a href='#f702' class='c019'><sup>[702]</sup></a> was a shelf-full in itself. It now fills, with some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_531'>531</span>fragments, nearly the whole of three great volumes of the
<span lang="fr"><cite>Panthéon Littéraire</cite></span>, and nearly two-thirds, certainly three-fifths,
of this are devoted to the French literature of the
eighteenth century, a subject for which, to speak frankly, it
may be doubted whether any posterity will have time corresponding
to spare. Even in the earlier and more general parts
there are defects, quite unconnected with the soundness or unsoundness
of La Harpe’s general critical position. There is
nothing which one should be slower to impute, save on the
very clearest evidence, than ignorance of a subject of which
a writer professes knowledge; and one should be slow, not
merely on general principles of good manners, but because
there is nothing which the baser kind of critic is so ready to
impute. But I own that, after careful reading and reluctantly,
I have come to the conclusion that La Harpe’s knowledge of the
classics left a very great deal to desire. That, in his survey of Epic,
he omits Apollonius Rhodius in his proper place altogether and
puts him in a postscript, might be a mere oversight, negligible
by all but the illiberal: unfortunately the postscript itself shows
no signs of critical appreciation. It is more unfortunate still
that he should say that all the writers of ancient Rome loaded
Catullus with eulogy, when we know that Horace only spares
him a passing sneer, that Quintilian has no notice for anything
but his “bitterness,” and that hardly anybody but Martial
does him real justice. However, we need not dwell on this. If
La Harpe was not very widely or deeply read in old-world or in
old-French literature, he certainly knew the French literature of
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries very well indeed.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the other hand, it is significant, and awkward, that, in
dealing with English, German, and other modern literatures, he
always seems to refer to translations, and hardly
ever ventures a criticism except on the mere matter
of the poem. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His critical position as</i> <span lang="la">ultimus suorum.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Moreover, which is of even more importance
for us, he was not in the slightest doubt
about his point of view either of these or of any other literature.
His censures and his praises are adjusted with almost unerring
accuracy to the neo-classic creed, as we have defined and illustrated
it in this volume. His <cite>Introduction</cite> pours all the scorn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_532'>532</span>he could muster on those who contemn the art of writing.
Even Shakespeare, coarse as he is, was not without learning.
That poet, Dante, and Milton executed “monstrous” works;
but in these monsters there were some beautiful parts done
according to “the principles.” And, to do him justice, he never
swerves or flinches from this. English has “an inconceivable
pronunciation.”<a id='r703'></a><a href='#f703' class='c019'><sup>[703]</sup></a> The <cite>Odyssey</cite> is an <i>Arabian Nights’</i> tale,
puerile, languid, seriously extravagant, even ignoble in parts.
The sojourns with Calypso and Circe offer nothing interesting
to La Harpe. The wonderful descent to Hades is as bad as that
of Æneas is admirable. La Harpe tells us that these and other
similar judgments are proofs of his severe frankness. They
certainly are; he has told us what he is.</p>

<p class='c000'>That after this he should pronounce the <cite>Georgics</cite> “the most
perfect poem transmitted to us by the Ancients”; fix on the
<cite>Prometheus</cite> his favourite epithet of “monstrous,” and say that it
“cannot even be called a tragedy”; think Plutarch thoroughly
justified in his censure of Aristophanes; read Thucydides with
less pleasure than Xenophon; and decide that Apuleius wrote
<span lang="fr"><i>vers le moyen age</i></span>, which was <span lang="fr"><i>un désert</i></span>,—these things do not
surprise us, nor that he should tolerate <cite>Ossian</cite> after not tolerating
Milton. It is in his fragment on the last-named poet that he
gives us his whole secret, with one of those intentional, yet really
unconscious, bursts of frankness which have been already noticed.
“<span lang="fr">La poésie,</span>” he says, “<span lang="fr">ne doit me peindre que ce que je peux
comprendre, admettre, ou supposer.</span>” That “suspension of disbelief”
in which, at no distant date, Coleridge was to discover
the real poetic effect would, it is clear, have been vehemently
resisted and refused by La Harpe, or rather it could never have
entered his head as possible.</p>

<p class='c000'>He remains therefore hopelessly self-shut out of the gates
of Poetry—only admitting and comprehending those beauties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_533'>533</span>which stray into the precinct of Rhetoric; discerning with horror
“monsters” within the gates themselves; and in his milder
moments conjecturing charitably that, if Dante, Shakespeare,
and Milton had only always observed the rules, which they
sometimes slipped into, they might have been nearly as good
poets—he will not say quite—as Racine and Voltaire. Never
have we met, nor shall we ever meet again, a critical Ephraim
so utterly joined to idols. It is unnecessary—it would even be
useless—to argue about him; he must be observed, registered,
and passed. Yet I do not pretend to regret the time which I
have myself spent over him. He writes well; he sees clearly
through his “monstrous” spectacles and subject to their laws;
above all, he has, what is, for some readers at any rate, the
intense and unfailing charm of “Thorough.” He is no cowardly
Braggadochio or inconstant Paridell: he is Sansfoy and Sansloy
in one—defending his Duessa, and perfectly ready to draw
sword and spend blood for her at any moment. Nor does he
wield the said sword by any means uncraftsmanly. Give him
his premisses and his postulates, his Rules, his false Reason
and sham Nature, his criterion of the admissible and comprehensible,
and he very seldom makes a false conclusion. Would
that all Gloriana’s own knights were as uncompromising, as
hardy, and as deft!</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the immense mass of Academic <span lang="fr"><cite>Éloges</cite></span>, and prize Essays
generally, composed during the eighteenth century, no extended
or minute account will be expected here. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Academic Essay.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> I have
myself, speaking without the slightest exaggeration,
read hundreds of them: indeed it is difficult to find
a French man of letters, of any name during the whole time, in
whose works some specimens of the kind do not figure. But—and
it is at once a reason for dealing with them generally and a
reason for not dealing with them as individuals—there is hardly
any kind of publication which more fatally indicates the defects
of the Academic system, and of that phase of criticism and
literary taste of which it was the exponent. They were written
in some cases—it is but repeating in other words what has
been just said—by men of the greatest talent; they constituted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_534'>534</span>with a play of one kind or another, the almost invariable <span lang="fr"><i>début</i></span>
of every Frenchman who had literary talent, great or small.
They exhibit a relatively high level of a certain kind of literary,
or at least rhetorical, attainment. But the last adjective has let
slip the dogs on them, for they are almost always rhetorical in
the worst senses of the word. Extensive reading in literature
was not wanted by the forty guards of the Capitol; original
thinking was quite certain to alarm them. The elegant nullity
of the Greek Declamation, and the <span lang="la"><i>ampullæ</i></span> of the Roman, were
the best things that were likely to be found. Yet sometimes
in literature, as in philosophy, the Academic Essay produced
remarkable things. And we may give some space to perhaps its
most remarkable writer towards the close of the time, a writer
symptomatic in the very highest degree, as showing the hold
which neo-classic ideas still had in France—that is to say,
Rivarol.<a id='r704'></a><a href='#f704' class='c019'><sup>[704]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>That “the St George of the epigram” might have been really
great as a critic there can be little doubt; besides lesser exercises
in this vocation, which are always acute if not
always quite just, he has left us two fairly solid
Essays, and a brilliant literary “skit,” to enable us to judge.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Rivarol.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The last of the three, the <span lang="fr"><cite>Almanach des Grands Hommes de nos
jours</cite></span>, does, with more wit, better temper, and better manners,
what Gifford was to do a little later in England; it is a sort of
sprinkling of an anodyne but potent Keating’s powder on the
small poets and men of letters of the time just before the
Revolution. But the treatise <span lang="fr"><cite>De l’Universalité de la Langue
Française</cite></span>, laid before the Academy of Berlin in 1783, and the
Preface to the writer’s Translation of the <span lang="it"><cite>Inferno</cite></span>, are really
solid documents. Both are prodigies of ingenuity, acuteness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_535'>535</span>and command of phrase, conditioned by want of knowledge
and by <span lang="fr"><i>parti pris</i></span>. How praise Dante better than by saying that
Italian took in his hands <span lang="fr">“une <span lang="fr"><i>fierté</i></span> qu’elle n’eut plus après
lui”</span>?<a id='r705'></a><a href='#f705' class='c019'><sup>[705]</sup></a> how better describe what we miss even in Ariosto, even
in Petrarch? Yet how go further astray than in finding fault
with the <span lang="it"><cite>Inferno</cite></span> because <span lang="fr">“on ne rencontre pas assez d’épisodes”</span>?<a id='r706'></a><a href='#f706' class='c019'><sup>[706]</sup></a>
What a critical piercing to the joints and marrow of the fault
of eighteenth-century poetry is the remark that Dante’s verses
<span lang="fr">“se tiennent debout par la seule force du substantif et du verbe
sans le concours d’une seule épithète!”</span> And what a falling off
is there when one passes from this to the old beauty-and-fault
jangles and jars!</p>

<p class='c000'>The <cite>Universality of French</cite><a id='r707'></a><a href='#f707' class='c019'><sup>[707]</sup></a> has many points of curiosity;
but we must abide by those which are strictly literary. The
temptation of the style to rhetoric, and, at the same time, “the
solace of this sin,” could hardly be better shown than in
Rivarol’s phrasing of the radical and inseparable clearness of
French, as “<span lang="fr">une probité attachée à son génie.</span>”<a id='r708'></a><a href='#f708' class='c019'><sup>[708]</sup></a> How happy is
the admission that poets of other countries “give their metaphors
at a higher strength,” “embrace the figurative style closer,”
and are deeper and fuller in colour! Yet the history, both
of French and English literature, given in each case at some
length, is inadequate and incorrect, the comparisons are childish,
and the vaticinations absurd. In fact, Rivarol was writing up
to certain fixed ideas, the chief of which was that the French
literature of 1660-1780 was the greatest that had ever existed—perhaps
that ever could exist—in the world.</p>

<p class='c000'>This notion—to which it is but just to admit that other
nations had given only too much countenance and support,
though England and Germany at least were fast emancipating
themselves—and the numbing effect of the general neo-classic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_536'>536</span>creed from which it was no very extravagant deduction, mar a
very large proportion<a id='r709'></a><a href='#f709' class='c019'><sup>[709]</sup></a> of French criticism during the century,
and, almost without exception, the whole of what we here call
its orthodox criticism. So long as it, or anything like it, prevails
in any country, at any time, the best criticism is impossible;
the “He followeth not <em>us</em>” interferes with all due appreciation.<a id='r710'></a><a href='#f710' class='c019'><sup>[710]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r673'>673</a>. It has been thought that this
passage, as glancing at the <cite>Henriade</cite>,
was one of the reasons of Voltaire’s

doubt something of youthful Romantic
naughtiness in it: but also something
more. The ode <em>has</em> a frigid Akensidish
grace; but there is too much
about axes and orbits therein: and
it is to be feared that this, rather
than the poetry, attracted the <span lang="fr"><i>philosophe</i></span>

has no doubt (i. 80, 81) of the excellence,

French taste has arrived; he only fears
that it may be impossible to guard

This extraordinary self-complacency is a
little less noticeable in England, but
only a little. When we thought that
Mr Pope had improved even upon Mr

<p class='c004'>It would be scarcely more than one of those sweeping generalisations
which attract a certain class of readers, if one were to
say that, during the eighteenth century, England
and France exercised a reciprocal influence over one
another in literature, the results of which the remaining
nations did little but imitate. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Preliminary remarks.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It is certainly true that, as
regards the special subject of this particular Book—the
criticism of orthodox neo-classicism in the eighteenth century—Germany,
Italy, and Spain play a part to which justice can
be very briefly done, while the rest may well be silence. Nor
will Spain and Italy at least have much more to give us
when, and if, in the next volume, we turn from the setting to
the rising sun. But it will be very different with Germany,
where almost the entire interest lies in the restless struggles
and obstinate questioning which lead to Romanticism, and
which practically show themselves from the very moment
when the Swiss School aroused German criticism from its
long sleep after Opitz. What has to be said of the Gottscheds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_538'>538</span>and Gellerts of the Northern Country had better be said last,
so as to bring the matter into closer juxtaposition with the
account of the Romantic Revolt itself. Italy (which has some
interest in at least the beginning of the century) and Spain,
which has very little in any part of it, must be taken first.</p>

<p class='c000'>For some reason, or for none, the closing years of the seventeenth
century, and the opening of the eighteenth, in Italy saw
a very considerable revival of that critical spirit
which, as we know, had died away so strangely, after
its vigorous flourishing a hundred years earlier. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Temporary revival of Italian Criticism.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It
is true that this new Italian criticism is of a rather
tell-tale kind—that it is, in great part at least, criticism
of erudition and of retrospect. But Gravina, Muratori, Crescimbeni,
and even Quadrio, form a group of no small interest.
The first is a real critic of great, if not always well-directed,
ability; the second, something of a real critic too, with amazing
erudition; the third, the author of the first really literary
history of a national literature; and the fourth, the first
pioneer—no Lynceus, certainly, but still a pioneer-guide—in
the ways of general and comparative literary study.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gianvincenzo Gravina is one of those persons who particularly
invite the student to idle <span lang="la"><i>ægri somnia</i></span> as to what they might
have been in other times and circumstances. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Gravina.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> A
lawyer, a <span lang="fr"><i>littérateur</i></span>, the adoptive father of Metastasio,
the joint founder of the Arcadian Academy, a critic of
remarkable shrewdness, who wrote excellent things on tragedy,
and thought his own bad tragedies excellent—he tempts one
strangely. His most famous and most often quoted critical
work is <span lang="it"><cite>Della Ragion Poetica</cite></span>,<a id='r711'></a><a href='#f711' class='c019'><sup>[711]</sup></a> but it is necessary, in order
to appreciate his criticism, to go to his <cite>Works</cite><a id='r712'></a><a href='#f712' class='c019'><sup>[712]</sup></a> and read also
the <span lang="it"><cite>Della Tragedia</cite></span> and the <span lang="it"><cite>Discorso delle Favole</cite></span>. The total
effect is, as with most other eighteenth-century critics, a conclusion
that the writer has not “found his way”: though he is
nearer to it than some others writing later. The <span lang="it"><cite>Della Ragion
Poetica</cite></span> is a most interesting labyrinth of cross-purposes. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_539'>539</span>strongly scholastic character of Italian serious thought, which
we have noticed in Rinaldini only a few years earlier,<a id='r713'></a><a href='#f713' class='c019'><sup>[713]</sup></a> betrays
itself in Gravina’s opening <span lang="it"><i>del vero e del falso</i></span>; <span lang="it"><i>del reale e del
finto</i></span>; and in an episodic discussion of the origin of Idolatry,
which may seem absolutely preposterous at first sight, but
which works itself into the consideration of Fable not so ill.
The admirable description of Homer as “the potentest of
mages and the wisest of enchanters, in that he makes use
of words not so much for the complacency of the ear as for
the advantage of the imagination,”<a id='r714'></a><a href='#f714' class='c019'><sup>[714]</sup></a> is balanced, at a page
or two’s distance, by a fling at the <span lang="it"><i>perniciosa turba de' Romanzi</i></span>.
The utility of poetry is gravely insisted on, and we are invited
as usual to the study of the Kinds; but section xiv., on “Popular
Judgment,” is instinct with that Italian common-sense which
had shown itself in various ways during the sixteenth century,
through mouths so different as those of Castelvetro and Cinthio
Giraldi, a sense almost epigrammatically concentrated in the
phrase <span lang="it"><i>ne con solo popolo ne senza il popolo</i></span>. In these passages
of Gravina’s there is to be found, put not indeed quite clearly,
but unmistakably on fair allowance, a doctrine which hardly
any critic of any day has sufficiently digested—that there is
something in poetry corresponding, in measure and degree, to
a poetical sentiment which only needs waking in all but the
exceptions of mankind. What libraries of vain or positively
mischievous disquisition should we have been spared, what
unintelligent laudation of Burns when the intelligent is so
easy, what unintelligent depreciation of Béranger when the
abstinence from it is surely not so difficult, what idle and
obstinate questionings about Donne or Whitman, Macaulay or
Moore, and a hundred others of the most opposite kinds, if
people would only have remembered our author’s sound and
sober law<a id='r715'></a><a href='#f715' class='c019'><sup>[715]</sup></a> that "in all men there gleams through [<span lang="it"><i>traspare</i></span>] I
know not what discernment of the Good "to which poets, if
they know how, can appeal!</p>

<p class='c000'>A large part of Gravina’s work in the <span lang="it"><cite>Ragion</cite></span> consists of an
actual historical survey of poets and poetry in the spirit which,
as we have seen and shall see, was so prevalent in his day; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_540'>540</span>his judgments, if a little traditional, are almost always sound,
whether he is dealing with the classics or with the great
Renaissance group of Italian-Latin poets.<a id='r716'></a><a href='#f716' class='c019'><sup>[716]</sup></a> Nor should he
lack due meed for the word of praise he gives to Folengo,
a writer little likely to appeal to the ordinary eighteenth-century
spirit. When one thinks of the extreme inadequacy
of French judgments of Rabelais himself at this time, it is
no small merit in Gravina to have said, of one of not the least
of Rabelais’ creditors, that “he wanted only will, not strength,
to write a noble poem,” and actually possessed learning, invention,
and fancy. The first book of the <span lang="it"><cite>Della Ragion Poetica</cite></span>
ends thus with an author who must have seemed, to the usual
eighteenth-century critic, nearly as sad and bad and mad as
Rabelais and Shakespeare,<a id='r717'></a><a href='#f717' class='c019'><sup>[717]</sup></a> and in whom it is not now difficult
to see much Rabelaisian and even some Shakespearian quality.
The second deals with the Italian vernacular. Gravina duly
admires Dante; but his elaborate apology for rhyme is noteworthy
and amusing. It was the way of the eighteenth
century to apologise for all sorts of things—from the Bible
downwards—that were not in the least need of it. He is
a little less shamefaced on the question of the vulgar tongue;
and says excellent things about the <span lang="la"><cite>De Vulgari</cite></span> itself—that
“discourse so subtle and so true.” Indeed he conducts his
whole discussion on the Vernacular, which is long, in accordance
with the principles of the tractate, and gives to Dante in
all nearly fifty pages, or more than half of the book, announcing
his deliberate intention <span lang="it"><i>giudicare spediatamente</i></span> of the rest from
Boiardo and Ariosto downwards. The whole forms a very
interesting survey of Italian poetry, though perhaps the most
interesting of Gravina’s separate critical utterances is to be
found, not in it but, in his short Latin Letter <span lang="la"><cite>De Poesi</cite></span> to
Maffei, in which he speaks of La Casa as <span lang="la"><i>qui alter potest haberi
a Petrarca Lyricorum princeps</i></span>. It is a bold saying, but not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_541'>541</span>hard to justify, concerning the author of <span lang="it"><cite>Errai gran tempo</cite></span> and
<span lang="it"><cite>O sonno, o de la queta</cite></span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The monumental work of Muratori in history and antiquities
has overshadowed his accomplishment in literature; and some
respectable books of reference hardly mention this;
but it is in fact considerable. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Muratori: his</i> <span lang="it">Della Perfetta Poesia.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> We have already had
occasion to refer to the service that he did in editing
the miscellaneous critical papers of Castelvetro, and he
also did important work on the Italian Theatre; but his <span lang="it"><cite>Della
Perfetta Poesia Italiana</cite></span><a id='r718'></a><a href='#f718' class='c019'><sup>[718]</sup></a> is a more original title-deed. There is
no doubt that it had great influence: some have even thought
that Luzán (<i>v. infra</i>, p. 548) was indebted to it for the impulse
which enabled him finally to overcome the remnants of Romantic
resistance in Spain, and to seat Neo-classicism at last triumphant
in the country of Don Quixote. But it does not need this
doubtful and reflected honour. The book is, given its lights and
its time, a very good book. It accepts, without much or any
demur, that notion of Good Taste which the seventeenth century
excogitated and the eighteenth almost universally accepted, postponing
inquiry whether it were the false Florimel or the true.
But Muratori is both a historian and a philosopher; and he
makes good use of both his qualifications. He contrasts, effectively
enough, the supposed infallibility of Petrarch in Taste,
the variety (without deserting this) of the sixteenth century, and
the <span lang="it"><i>pessimo gusto</i></span> of that which had just closed when he wrote.
He will have it that Poetry is “a daughter and servant of Moral
Philosophy”—in which case it must be sadly admitted that
the mother is too often not justified of the daughter, and that
the service is not seldom unprofitable. But he comes (perhaps
inspired by Tasso) nearer to universal acceptance when he tells
us that Poetic Beauty is “a new and marvellously delightful
Truth,” and he is specially copious on the Fancy—so much so
that one imagines it not impossible that Addison may have seen
the treatise, more particularly as there is much about “True and
False Wit” in the Second Book of the <span lang="it"><cite>Perfetta Poesia</cite></span>. He is,
in his Third Book, liberal on the question of Useful or Delightful—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_542'>542</span>latter will do very well if it is healthy delight<a id='r719'></a><a href='#f719' class='c019'><sup>[719]</sup></a>—and he
discusses the defects of poets, and the various parts of poetry,
with sense and discrimination. All this is of course still too
much “in the air”; it makes the old mistake of taking for
granted that <span lang="la"><i>poesis</i></span> can be in some way strained off, or distilled
from, <span lang="la"><i>poeta</i></span> and <span lang="la"><i>poema</i></span>. But this defect is to some extent
repaired in the sequel, and the whole is a book far from
despicable. The chief defect of it (a defect which extends also
to Gravina) is the absence of comparative criticism—of the
attempt, at least, to study literature as a whole.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two historians, especially Quadrio, are freer from this
defect, though by no means free from it; but they compensate
for this advantage by a much weaker dose of really
critical spirit. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Crescimbeni.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Crescimbeni is not an unimportant
figure in the History of his own literature, to which he contributed,
after writing in 1700 on <span lang="it"><cite>La Bellezza del Volgar Poesia</cite></span>,
a regular work<a id='r720'></a><a href='#f720' class='c019'><sup>[720]</sup></a> on the whole subject as far as poetry is
concerned. Part, and the best part, of this is made up of
a refashioning of the <span lang="it"><cite>Bellezza</cite></span>. Its contents, which are not
contemptible, though too like much that we have already gone
through to require minute attention, are almost indicated by its
title—an enumeration of poetical beauties, cautions against defects
and mistakes in the application of them, and the usual
analysis of Kinds. The rest of the book is a really valuable
literary encyclopædia, with extracts, commentaries, lists, indices,
&#38;c., “all very capital” in their own way, but somewhat out of
ours.</p>

<p class='c000'>If Quadrio seems to invite more attention, it is partly because
of his goodly bulk which fills the eye, and partly because of the
oddity of some of his judgments, but partly also (in
a third part) because he really intends to be critical,
and because he extends his view far beyond Italian. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Quadrio.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The <span lang="it"><cite>Della
Storia e della Ragione d’Ogni Poesia</cite></span><a id='r721'></a><a href='#f721' class='c019'><sup>[721]</sup></a> is a sufficiently ambitious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_543'>543</span>attempt; and I do not think I know anything of the kind, by
a single man, which is at any rate more voluminous. Seven big
quartos, tightly packed, give Quadrio ample room and verge
enough for proceedings alike methodical and far-ranging in
their method; and his <span lang="it"><cite>Distinzioni</cite></span>—the sub-divisions of his
Books—leave few things unattempted. He is able to include
both branches of Patrizzi’s old division, <span lang="it"><cite>Disputata</cite></span> and <span lang="it"><cite>Istoriale</cite></span>,
and he extends the purview of the latter as widely as he can, if
not as happily. The good faith, and the less than doubtful
judgment, of some of his excursions will be sufficiently, and
here most interestingly, demonstrated by some instances from
his English notes. After devoting great space to the usual
general questions of the nature, origin, position, &#38;c., of poetry,
he has a proportionately large distribution of Kinds, extending
not merely into Acrostic-land but into Cento and Macaronic. He
deals further with Poetic Art and Poetic Fury, and, in successive
<i>Distinzioni</i>, with Plot and Manners, Erudition, Verse in general,
Italian verse, &#38;c. Then he attacks the actual contents of his
subject, and devotes the whole of a volume of 800 pages to
“Melic” or Lyric poetry. It cannot but be interesting to the
reader to note who represented English Lyric poetry to the eyes
of a learned and laborious Italian Jesuit in the second quarter
of the eighteenth century; but it is pretty safe to say that not
one of a hundred guessers would name the trio in a hundred
guesses each. They are Gower, “Arthur Kelton,” and
“Wicherley.”<a id='r722'></a><a href='#f722' class='c019'><sup>[722]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>He proceeds through all the divisions in the same way. His
notice of Shakespeare is obviously a recollection of the milder
view of Voltaire, who was a friend of Quadrio’s. Dryden wrote
a “tragedy” entitled <cite>King Arthur</cite>; Addison is treated at
length, and with evident sympathy, as well as with at least
<span class='pageno' id='Page_544'>544</span>more direct knowledge than that shown of “Il Benjanson”
(<i>sic</i>). There is a whole chapter on Milton, in which Rapin
and the Chevalier Ramsay<a id='r723'></a><a href='#f723' class='c019'><sup>[723]</sup></a> are quoted. The critic is aware
of (let us hope he had not read) Glover’s <cite>Leonidas</cite>; and he is
naturally copious on Pope, though his section on <cite>The Rape of
the Lock</cite> shades itself off in the oddest manner into a Discourse
on Hair, with references to Apuleius and the obliging Fotis,
to Dion Chrysostom, and to Firenzuola. But Chaucer and
Spenser are not (unless I have missed them) discussed by
the citer of Arthur Kelton.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course there is no need to laugh at Quadrio; and if we do
it must be done only in the most good-humoured and politest
way possible. Doubtless we all make mistakes in dealing with
foreign Literatures; and those of us who have dealt most with
them have doubtless sinned most. But what is important to
notice here about the Historian of All Poetry is—first, that he
has shrewdly seen and manfully accepted, if not the necessity,
at least the immense advantage, of comparative literary study;
and secondly, that while emancipating himself to this extent,
he is still under the domination of Kinds. If he had gone to A.
Kelton himself, and had examined that worthy’s works—not to
range him under Melic or Epic or anything <span lang="la"><cite>quod exit in ’ic</cite></span>, but—to
see whether he wrote good or bad poetry, he would at least
have been in a fairer way of escape. But the mania for Kind-
and Subject-division, instead of studying poetic treatment, can
hardly be better illustrated than in Quadrio, whose schedule
of narrative poetry, for instance, is as complicated and as
meticulous as a Government return.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet the value of his attempt, and in a less degree of Crescimbeni’s,
is very great: and it perhaps exceeds in <em>general</em> critical
importance the results of the exercise of the superior talent of
Muratori and Gravina. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The emergence of literary history.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> These latter said more noteworthy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_545'>545</span>things than the others: but they said them in a kind of criticism
which, to speak our best for it, had already done all
the good that was in it to do. Nay, their method of
handling was likely to stand in the way of real critical
advance or recovery, not to help it. Crescimbeni
and Quadrio, especially the latter, recognised indeed, if they did
not themselves quite understand, or lay down in so many words
for the instruction of others, the great fact that before all things,
and for some time at any rate instead of all things, it was time
for criticism to “take stock”—that instead of theorising at large,
and controlling the theory at best by a partial study of the
classics and a very limited and arbitrary selection of the literature
of the student’s own country, it was time for him to take
the whole of that literature, to compare it with the whole of the
classics, and, so far as he possibly could, with the whole of
foreign modern literature as a third standard. That is practically
what we have been doing for nearly two hundred years
past, more or less—for more than a hundred years past, pretty
steadily and with a will. It is not done yet; and it never can
be done wholly, because every generation and every country
adds, in its varying measure and degree, fresh supplies of matter
which cannot be digested all at once, but which must sooner or
later be added to the rest, and may affect conclusions drawn
from that rest, as vitally as did the work of Dante or that of
Shakespeare. But it has been done, and is being done, after a
fashion in which, before the time of these two Italian historians,
it had hardly been done by anybody.</p>

<p class='c000'>The promise, however, of this group—the elder of whose
members almost belong to the seventeenth century, while the
youngest does not come below the middle of the
eighteenth—was not fulfilled. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Further decadence of Italian Criticism.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Hardly a single
person among the other (and chiefly later) Italian
critics of the time has achieved, or, so far as I have
been able to inform myself, has deserved to achieve, any great
reputation. Tiraboschi indeed continued the merely historical
part of Crescimbeni’s labour with an industry probably unparalleled
in any other <a id='corr545.37'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='country'>country.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_545.37'><ins class='correction' title='country'>country.</ins></a></span> <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Metastasio.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Metastasio, in his later days,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_546'>546</span>occupied himself a good deal with criticism, and at an earlier
time his <span lang="it"><cite>Estratto dell' Arte Poetica d’Aristotile</cite></span><a id='r724'></a><a href='#f724' class='c019'><sup>[724]</sup></a>
would have deserved a good deal of attention from
us. At his own date Metastasio is partly an eminent example
of that halting between two opinions which has been so often
mentioned, partly an inheritor of others’ thoughts. He is in
hardly any sense a Romantic; yet he observes, against the
Dacierian extension and hardening of Aristotle’s definition
of poetry, that if this be so “it will be very difficult to find
any writer who is not a poet”, and a little farther he has
excogitated, or borrowed from the æestheticians, the all-important
doctrine that the object of the sculptor is “not the
illusion of the spectator but his own victory over the marble.”
But these things are late, transitional, and, perhaps, as has been
hinted, borrowed. The earlier critical work of the polygraphic,
polyglottic, and polypragmatic Marquis Scipione Maffei has
no distinction: and the very names<a id='r725'></a><a href='#f725' class='c019'><sup>[725]</sup></a> of Palesi, Salio, Denina,
Zanotti are unknown to all but special students of Italian
literature, and probably to not a few of these. We must come
to quite modern times—to times indeed so near our own that
the rule of silence as to living contemporaries may often come
into operation—before we can find any heirs to the glory of
Castelvetro and Patrizzi, if we can find them then.</p>

<p class='c004'>The singularity which in so many ways besets Spanish
literature shows itself, perhaps not least, in the fact that the
establishment of the neo-classic creed in Spain does
not take place till that creed is beginning to be, in
one way or another, deserted or undermined in other
countries. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Neo-classicism triumphs in Spain.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It must be admitted that there was some
excuse for Don Ignacio de Luzán Claramunt de Suelves y
Gurrea, whose <span lang="es"><i>Poética</i></span> in 1737 argued Spain’s poetry away, far
more actually than Cervantes had ever laughed away her
chivalry. It has been usual to represent Luzán as a mere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_547'>547</span>populariser of Boileau in Spain: but this is not just. Any one
who has followed the course of reading which this book
represents will see that it was the <span lang="es"><i>antiqua mater</i></span> of Spanish
criticism, Italy, which really started Luzán’s inquiries—that
Muratori, and perhaps Gravina, rather than Boileau and the
French schoolmen, were his masters. Indeed it seems that he
had actually sketched, in Italian and in Italy (or at least Sicily),
certain <span lang="it"><cite>Ragionamenti sopra la Poesia</cite></span>, nearly a decade before his
Spanish book appeared.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was, it has been said, some excuse for him. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The absurdities of Artiga.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> We have
seen in the last Book that, though isolated expressions and
<span lang="fr"><i>aperçus</i></span> of remarkable promise and acuteness appear in Spanish
criticism of the seventeenth century, it was always <span lang="la"><i>impar sibi</i></span>,
and was constantly aiming at the establishment of a kind of
illegitimate compromise between the national drama, which the
critics would not give up, and the general theories of literature
which they did not dare—perhaps did not wish—to impugn.
In fact, this state of compromise, by yet another of the anomalies
above referred to, anticipates the similar things which we see in
England and in France, in Italy and in Germany, much later.
At the same time, Spain had been a special victim, with Gongorism
and Culteranism and Conceptism, of those contortions of the
Romantic agony which, all over Europe, invited the tyranny of
neo-classicism. Also its great creative period had closed for
some considerable time. Lastly, there had survived in Spain a
kind of childishly scholastic rhetoric, which the rest of Europe,
with some slight exceptions in Italy, had long outgrown.
Ticknor, the most amiable of Historians (when Protestantism is
not in point), calls by the name of “a really ridiculous book” the
<span lang="es"><cite>Epitome de la Eloquencia Española</cite></span> of Don Francisco
José Artiga or Artieda, to which he gives the date
of 1725, but of which the British Museum copy bears
a date more than thirty years earlier.<a id='r726'></a><a href='#f726' class='c019'><sup>[726]</sup></a> People are apt to be so
unkind to technical <cite>Rhetorics</cite> and <cite>Poetics</cite> that I own I had a
faint hope, before I actually read this book, of being able to
remonstrate with the Ticknorian judgment: but <span lang="es"><i>no puede ser</i></span>.
The work is dedicated to Francesco Borgia, Duke of Gandia—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_548'>548</span>tragic elder associations of the name serving, to those who
are susceptible to such things, as a sort of heightening of the
farce. It consists of verse-dialogues, in octosyllabic quatrain,
between a <span lang="es"><i>Hijo</i></span> and a <span lang="es"><i>Padre</i></span> by way of question and answer.
Eloquence is angelic, celestial, ethereal, elementary, mixed,
dumb, and several other things. Receipts and formulas are
given for all sorts of compositions down to visiting cards: and
the style of exposition may perhaps best be appreciated from an
extract of two quatrains—</p>

<p class='c030'>One is too apt to forget, in censuring eighteenth-century
flippancy and superficiality in regard to the past, that all over
Europe, more or less, this kind of childish stuff was still actually
taught.</p>

<p class='c000'>Luzán is at least not childish, though he betrays the insufficient
historical examination and the hasty generalising
which beset the whole school. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Luzán.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He devotes the
principal attention of his folio,<a id='r727'></a><a href='#f727' class='c019'><sup>[727]</sup></a> after generalities
avowedly taken from Muratori, to Epic and Tragedy, and
while using complimentary words to Lope and Calderon, indicates,
without doubt or hesitation, that his heart is with
Corneille and Racine. It is true that he is himself—as all
these Eighteenth-century “classics” are without exception, save
the mere school dogmatists or the obstinate reactionaries like
La Harpe—inconsistent. Mr Fitzmaurice Kelly<a id='r728'></a><a href='#f728' class='c019'><sup>[728]</sup></a> goes so far
as to say that there is hardly a proposition in his book which is
not contradicted elsewhere in it. But that he at least meant
to be a neo-classic, a Unitarian, a Nicolaitan, there can be no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_549'>549</span>doubt, nor any that he met with no markworthy or effectual
resistance.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rest of the Spanish criticism of the eighteenth century
has, save for special students of Spanish literature, and perhaps
even for them, very little interest; <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The rest uninteresting.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> and it is noticeable
that, from this point, even the accomplished and
indefatigable historian of the subject<a id='r729'></a><a href='#f729' class='c019'><sup>[729]</sup></a> practically breaks away
from Spain itself, and gives a history of æsthetic ideas, not as
they arose, and developed, and changed, and fell there, but rather
as they went through these phases in Europe at large. The
better known names of Spanish authors of the time, such as
Isla and Feyjóo, have a certain right to figure here, but their
literary critical work is only a part, and not a very important or
interesting part, of the extension of the <span lang="de"><cite>Aufklärung</cite></span>, especially in
the forms which it assumed in France, to the most bigoted and
conservative (except its sister Portugal) of European countries.
This process, though perhaps necessary, is not in any department,
political, religious, or other, particularly grateful to study;
for Spain lost venerable and fascinating illusions—if illusions
they were—to gain a very shallow, dubious, and second-rate
civilisation and enlightenment. And this was almost more the
case in literature than anywhere else.</p>

<p class='c000'>Feyjóo’s <span lang="es"><cite>Teátro Crίtico</cite></span>, a series of Essays published between
1726 and 1738, and his <cite>Letters</cite>, which after a short
interval he began in 1742, and continued at intervals
for eighteen years more, are more philosophical
and “moral,” in the French sense, than literary. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The rest uninteresting.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But the
“Spanish Hotel de Rambouillet”—the “Academy of good
taste” which met about the middle of the century at the
house of the Countess de Lemos—included not only Luzán,
but another <span lang="fr"><i>littérateur</i></span> of high rank, Luis José Velasquez,
Marquis of Valdeflores, with Nasarre y Ferriz, and others.
The whole school was rather anti-national, but Gregorio
Mayáns y Siscar, their contemporary, did great service to
Spanish literature by publishing the <cite>Origins</cite>, to which we have
been indebted above,<a id='r730'></a><a href='#f730' class='c019'><sup>[730]</sup></a> and some by compiling a <cite>Rhetoric</cite>, traditional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_550'>550</span>enough, but not specially “Gallo”-Classic. The famous
Father Isla not only attacked the remnants of extravagant
style, which had sought refuge in the Spanish pulpit, in <span lang="es"><cite>Fray
Gerundio</cite></span>, the one Spanish book of this time, which became
a European possession, but left unpublished other critical
work, especially in his poem of <span lang="es"><cite>Ciceron</cite></span>, much of which is
satirically critical of literature. Isla was probably more of
a patriot than of a critic in his well-known attempt to claim <span lang="es"><cite>Gil
Blas</cite></span> for Spain, not merely in suggestion but in direct original.
Nor should we omit to mention with honour, as members of
that invaluable class of restorers of ancient literature which
arose in almost all countries in the latter half of the century,
Sedano of the <cite>Spanish Parnassus</cite>, Sanchez of the <span lang="es"><cite>Poesias Anteriores
al Siglo</cite></span> <span class='fss'>XV</span>, and Sarmiento, the first general Historian
of Old Spanish Poetry. Their work was, if a somewhat slow,
a sure and certain antidote to the Gallicism of Moratin (Luzán’s
chief successor) and others of the later time.<a id='r731'></a><a href='#f731' class='c019'><sup>[731]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004'>Despite some exceptions (which only prove the rule rather
more than is usual), and despite the immense dead-lift which at
one time they gave, or helped to give, to criticism,
the Germans have never been very good critics.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Rise at last of German Criticism.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> There has always been too much in them of the
girl in the fable who jumped on the floor to hunt mice, instead
of attending to the more important business and pleasure of
the occasion. And though that dead-lift which has been referred
to began extremely early in the eighteenth century, its history
belongs to our next volume. It is, indeed, less easy to effect
the separation which our plan demands here than anywhere
else; for hardly had German vernacular criticism begun to
exert itself once more, after its long inertia since Opitz, than
the double current of abstract æstheticism, and of study of
Romantic literature, began to appear. But it would be impossible
to omit from a gallery or panorama of Neo-classicism
such a typical specimen of the <span lang="es"><i>perruque</i></span> as Gottsched, such an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_551'>551</span>eminent example of the “man who looks over his shoulder”
as Gellert. And though we must leave substantive dealings
with Bodmer, Breitinger, and their fellows and followers to that
early division of the next volume in which, with leave of
Nemesis, Germany will be compensated for the little pride of
place she has hitherto enjoyed, it will be very proper here
at least to mention the singular and interesting process of
novitiate by which the Germans vindicated their character
as the good boys of technical education; and, by sheer hard
study and omnivorous reading, put the national abilities into a
condition to turn out a Lessing and a Goethe.</p>

<p class='c000'>The means—sufficiently obvious, but not often resorted to
save by those nations which have not “decayed through pride”—were
those of abundant translation from the more
forward vernaculars, as well as from the classics.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Its school time.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The German <span lang="de"><i>Sammlungen</i></span> of the first half of the eighteenth
century<a id='r732'></a><a href='#f732' class='c019'><sup>[732]</sup></a> are very interesting things. From French, from English,
from the Latin writings of the previous century, they
selected, and batched together, critical tractates which they
thought might do them good, taking these to heart with
Aristotle and Horace, with Boileau and Vida. That the
assemblage had sometimes something of a “Groves of Blarney”
character—that people like Camusat<a id='r733'></a><a href='#f733' class='c019'><sup>[733]</sup></a> find themselves
jostling Pope and Addison among writers of Belles-Lettres,
and Vossius and Casaubon among scholars, mattered not so
very much. Manure, seed, patterns (to take various lines of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_552'>552</span>metaphor) were what the German mind wanted; and it
received them in plenty, and certainly not without good
result.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are some very good authorities<a id='r734'></a><a href='#f734' class='c019'><sup>[734]</sup></a> who do not see much
difference between Gottsched and his adversaries of the Swiss
school, Bodmer and Breitinger. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Classicism at bay almost from the first: Gottsched.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> I am not able to agree
with them. That there are characteristics in common
nobody can deny,—that Gottsched is of the
evening and Bodmer and Breitinger of the morning
of the same day on the older arrangement, I do most sincerely
think. And “the German Johnson”—so <span lang="de"><i>echt-deutsch</i></span> and so
little Johnsonian—is much too characteristic and agreeable a
figure not to have some substantive place here. It is interesting
no doubt—and it would give an excellent subject for one of
the many not-to-be-written <span lang="la"><i>excursus</i></span> of this history—that he, the
analogue, to some extent, in Germany, of Johnson himself in England
and of La Harpe in France, comes far earlier than these
representatives of the neo-classicism which “makes an end” in
countries far more accomplished in literature. But this is
natural. The seventeenth century in Germany had but been
one long fallow, producing nothing but not unfascinating weeds,
like Lohenstein and Hoffmanswaldau, or wildings like Grimmelshausen.
But, as in other cases of fallow, the rains of
heaven had descended, and the winds had blown, and the
worms had done their work of breaking up, and the soil, if
technically “foul,” was also fertile. Its production was necessarily
mixed; but it was at any rate not subject to the
desperate hook of the preceptist weeder, or to the traditional
courses of the orthodox agriculturist. The German man of
letters of 1700-1750 had the “Y” before him as few men of
letters have had.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gottsched took the classical branch of the letter unflinchingly,
and quarrelled with others, like a good party man, as he
realised that they were taking the Romantic. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Versuch einer Critischen Dichtkunst.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> His <span lang="de"><cite>Versuch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_553'>553</span>einer Critischen Dichtkunst</cite></span><a id='r735'></a><a href='#f735' class='c019'><sup>[735]</sup></a> is frontispieced with a striking
picture of Apollo, and the Muses, and Pegasus looking
benignly at Bellerophon(?), whom he is just
pitching off, and Mercury, probably flying, but in appearance
rather tumbling, down the Holy Hill, with
a copy of Horace in his hand, and a group of critics and poets
and personified Kinds of poetry waiting to receive it in ecstatic
attitudes at the bottom. It has three separate dedication-pages,
in the largest print, to three fair ladies of the same family,—the
high-born Countess and Lady, Lady Ernestine Wilhelmine,
widowed Baroness von Plotho, born Reichsgräfinn von Manteufel,
“my especially gracious Countess and Lady”; the high-born
Countess Johanna Henrietta Constantia, born the same,
“my especially gracious Countess”; and my ditto the high-born
Countess Louisa Marianne, born the same,—not to mention a
beautiful Ode, several Prefaces, an Introduction, and the full
text, with translation in German Alexandrines, of the <span lang="la"><cite>Ars
Poetica</cite></span> itself. If writer and reader do not feel themselves safe
under the convoy of all these charming spells and periapts, it is
surely a pity.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would, however, be most uncritical, and entirely unjust to
Gottsched, to assert or insinuate that his apparatus is mere
matter of parade. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Its chief idea.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> On the contrary, the preface to
the second edition first enumerates as “the greatest
connoisseurs and masters of Poetic,” Aristotle, Horace, Longinus,
Scaliger, Boileau, Bossu, Dacier, Perrault, Bouhours,
Fénelon, Saint-Evremond, Fontenelle, La Motte, Corneille,
Racine, Callières, Furetière, Shaftesbury, Addison, Steele,
Castelvetro, Muralt, and Voltaire. For all of whom, except
where (like Béat de Muralt, for instance) they have been reserved
for reasons,<a id='r736'></a><a href='#f736' class='c019'><sup>[736]</sup></a> reference may be made to other pages of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_554'>554</span>the present History. It afterwards specially alleges, as additional
authorities, Riccoboni’s history of the Italian Stage, an
anonymous <span lang="it"><cite>Paragone della Poesia Tragica d' Italia con quella de
Francia</cite></span> which I have not seen, Rapin, Brumoy [spelt Brumo<em>is</em>],
Hédelin, Rémond de Saint-Mard, an English <span lang="la"><i>anonymus</i></span><a id='r737'></a><a href='#f737' class='c019'><sup>[737]</sup></a> on <em>The
Taste of the Town</em>, Ramsay, Pope, Casaubon, Heinsius, Voss,
Rappolt, and Sebastian Regulus his Imitations of the First
Book of the <cite>Æneis</cite> (which last I have not read and do not
think I intend to read). In the Preface to the Third Edition
his quarrel with the Swiss school breaks out. We shall see in
future, I trust, what this school taught; it is here of chief, if
not of only, import to know what, according to Gottsched, the
“Zürichers” (<i>i.e.</i>, those about Bodmer) did <cite>not</cite> teach and he did.
“While I,” he says in mingled pride and indignation, “after
treating of poetry in general, have dealt with all its Kinds, and
given its own rules to each, so that beginners may turn them
out impeccably, the Zürich poetic has nothing of the sort.”
“Man would,” adds Gottsched incredulously and detesting,
“thereout neither an Ode nor a Cantata, neither an Eclogue
nor an Elegy, neither a Verse Epistle nor a Satire, neither an
Epigram nor a Song of Praise, neither an Epic nor a Tragedy,
neither a Comedy nor an Opera to make learn!”<a id='r738'></a><a href='#f738' class='c019'><sup>[738]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The Slurk-and-Pott objurgation which follows concerns us
little. But the passage just quoted has real weight. For it
shows how, to the absolute and half-incredulous horror of one
party, and probably by the not entirely conscious or intentional
purpose of the other, the battle of Rule-poetic against Appreciation-poetic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_555'>555</span>had begun. To Gottsched the Art, or Science,
or what-not, of Poetry is a huge schedule, which may be quite
emptied of actual contents and yet retain its pre-established
compartments and the rules for filling them; to his adversaries
Poetry itself is a library, a treasury, a new world full of things
and persons that cause, or do not cause, the poetic pleasure.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would be unnecessary to analyse this not quite “the poor
last” of Classical <cite>Poetics</cite>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Specimen details.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It may be sufficient to say that
Gottsched has his first or general and his second
or particular book, the first dealing with the origin
and growth of poetry, the character and taste of a poet, the
species of poetic imitation, the Wonderful in poetry, the Admirable
in poetry, and the like, the second with the usual Kinds in
regular order. His occasional utterances are, at this stage of
the history, of far greater importance. We find (p. 86) the
sonnet classed with madrigals, rondeaux, and other “little things
which are worth little.” The old German <span lang="de"><i>Heldengedichten</i></span> are
(p. 88), if not so good as Homer, Virgil, and Voltaire, yet not so
bad as Marino, Ariosto, Chapelain, Saint-Amand, and Milton.<a id='r739'></a><a href='#f739' class='c019'><sup>[739]</sup></a>
Later (p. 109), “Among Englishmen, who are specially inclined
to excessive fantasy, Milton in his <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> has exhibited
everything that man can possibly do in this kind of <span lang="de"><i>schwärmerei</i></span>.”
It is well to remember that the detested Zürichers were special
admirers of Milton; but there is no reason to suspect Gottsched
of being unduly biassed by this, either here or in the
longer examination which he gives to Milton’s sins afterwards.
He is almost as severe on Ariosto (p. 209), arguing with unruffled
gravity that the discoveries of Astolfo (which he sums up as
solemnly as a judge) are not probable, and finishing with the
sad observation that the Italian’s fantasies are really more like
a sick man’s dream than like the reasonable inventions of a
poet.</p>

<p class='c000'>The good Gottsched, in fact, is an apostle not so much even
of classicism as of that hopeless <em>prosaism</em> to which classicism
<span class='pageno' id='Page_556'>556</span>lent itself but too easily.<a id='r740'></a><a href='#f740' class='c019'><sup>[740]</sup></a> Even Voltaire is not sufficiently <span lang="de"><i>wahrscheinlich</i></span>
for him; and he asks (pp. 183, 215) in agitated tones
whether Herr Voltaire, who has elsewhere such sound ideas on
the Highest of Beings, has not made a mistake in the magic
scenes of the <cite>Henriade</cite>? He is, however, no friend to prosaic
diction, and stoutly defends what he calls (p. 263) “good florid expression,”<a id='r741'></a><a href='#f741' class='c019'><sup>[741]</sup></a>
giving some better examples, from poets like Amthor
and Flemming, than those who regard the German seventeenth
century as a mere desert might expect. So long as he can get
these flights under the recognised Figures, and so long as they
do not outstep “the rules of prudence” (273), all is well. But
the outstepping, as may be guessed, is not very far off. He
finds it, under the guidance of Bouhours, in Malherbe of all
remarkable places, and naturally much more in Hoffmanswaldau
and Lohenstein, as well as in Ariosto and Marino and Gracián,—being
as severe on <i>galimatias</i> and “Phébus” as he had previously
(and quite justly) been against that medley of German-French
which Opitz had long before condemned. There is, in
fact, a good deal of sense as well as of minuteness in Gottsched’s
particular rules, both as to poetry in general and as to the
Kinds. In dealing with these last he gives very extensive
examples, and since these are taken from a division of poetry
not much in most readers’ way, they are distinctly interesting.
But we must not follow him into these details; nor is it at
all necessary to do so. The neo-classic critic has at least the
virtue of adhering to his own rules, and observing his own type,
with Horatian strictness. There is little danger of finding in
him a politic Achilles, a prudent youth, or an old man who is
good-humoured and does not praise the past. Gottsched says
of Epic and Romance, of Comedy and Tragedy, exactly what we
should expect him to say, if not exactly what we may think he
ought to have said. He cannot understand how Tasso could
hope to “unite this Gothic taste of chivalrous books” (p. 682)
with the Greek rules of Heroic poetry; and he makes so bold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_557'>557</span>as almost to rebuke the great Voltaire for according the name
of Heroic poem to the <cite>Lusiad</cite> and the <cite>Araucana</cite>. But there is
a characteristic note in the words, “It is time to leave the historic-critic
part and come to the dogmatic,” which, it seems, we
shall find—all of it—in Aristotle, Dacier, and Le Bossu. It is,
in a different relation, like Balzac’s <span lang="fr"><i>passons aux choses réelles</i></span>—“Never
mind the Poems: come to the Rules!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Gellert, a pupil of Gottsched, at any rate for a time, and a
pretty poet in his own way, betrays that tendency to compromise,
if not actually to capitulate, which we have
seen in parts of French Classicism. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Gellert: he transacts.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> His principal
critical tractate<a id='r742'></a><a href='#f742' class='c019'><sup>[742]</sup></a> carries a confession in its very title, “How
far the Use of the Rules extends in Rhetoric and Poetry,” and
the confession is emphasised in the text. It comes to this—that
the Rules are useful, but only generally so, and with a
“thus far and no further.” It is evident that, when this point
is reached, the Oppression of Gwenhidwy is on the eve of descending
upon the land of Gwaelod, the dykes are bursting,
and the sea is flowing in.<a id='r743'></a><a href='#f743' class='c019'><sup>[743]</sup></a> We saw just now Gottsched’s indignant
horror at the idea of writing upon poetry without
giving rules to anybody how he shall do anything. He must
have been more horrified still, because there is an element of
treacherous surrender instead of bold defiance in it, at this other
view of the rules as not bad things in their way—to be followed
when it is convenient and when you please, and broken or
left behind when it is convenient, or when you please again.
In fact, any such admission at once reduces the whole Neoclassic
system to an absurdity. A law which may be obeyed
or not exactly as people choose—a sealed pattern which is followed
or not at the taste and fancy of the tailor or other craftsman—you
surely cannot too soon repeal the first and throw the
second into the dustbin. And this was, as we shall see, what
Germany very speedily did.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<h3 class='c021'>I.</h3>

<p class='c022'>In the present Interchapter, as in that at the close of the former
volume, it seems desirable to make the summary twofold: in
the first place, with reference to the Book which the chapter
immediately follows, so as to provide a corresponding view to
that given by the Interchapters of the two earlier Books in the
volume itself; in the second, surveying the State of Criticism—with
a look before and after—at the period which we have
reached. This survey is here of even more importance than it
was on the former occasion because of the greater—in fact the
almost absolute—homogeneity of the subject. But it comes second
in order, and for the moment we must busy ourselves only
with that portion or side of Eighteenth-Century Criticism itself
which has been considered in the last three chapters.</p>

<p class='c000'>In one way Eighteenth-Century criticism has a very notable
advantage over Seventeenth and Sixteenth. In the earliest of
the three, as we saw, criticism exists almost without a critic.
Its authorities are either men of something less (to speak kindly)
than the first rank as men of letters, or else they devote only a
slight and passing attention to the subject. In the Seventeenth
this is not quite so, for Dryden is a host in himself, and Boileau,
to name nobody else, is no common man of letters.</p>

<p class='c000'>But in the Eighteenth the case is far more altered. English
and French, the two leading literatures of Europe, are copiously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_560'>560</span>and intensely critical, if not entirely according to knowledge.
Addison, Johnson, Pope, Voltaire, are all dictators of literature,
whose fame and authority, in the case at least of the two last,
go far beyond their own country—and they are all critics. In
another country, though in a division, for reasons, not yet
noticed, Goethe, who, if any one, is the representative man of
letters in his own nation, is a critic. The second class of names—mentioned
or to be mentioned—Vico, Shaftesbury, Lessing, Gray,
Buffon, Diderot, and others, approaches very nearly, if it does not
sometimes reach, the first rank. Moreover, criticism has enormously
<em>multiplied</em> its appearances and opportunities of appearance:
it has, in a manner, become popular. The critical Review—the
periodical by means of which it is possible, and becomes
easy, to give critical account of the literature, not merely of the
past but of the present—becomes common. The critic as such
is no longer regarded as a mere pedant; he at least attempts to
take his place as a literary man of the world. If Italy and
Spain fail—even allowing for the remarkable Italian critical
group at the beginning of the century—to justify their old
reputation, Germany, on the other hand, begins that career of
critical hard labour to which she has apparently sentenced
herself in perpetuity, and relieves it with more excursions into
the fairer letters than of late. The French, though subject more
severely than men of any other country to the idols of the time,
continue to justify themselves both in the lighter and the severer
critical work.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the contribution of England is the most interesting of
all. Our position at the time may be compared, with some
advantage and no danger of straining, to that of Spain at a
somewhat earlier period (see pp. 338-350). We do not indeed
find, in any English critic after Dryden, formal expressions of
such weight and pregnancy in the Romantic direction as those
which the sharp-sightedness and patience of Señor Menéndez y
Pelayo have extracted from the Spanish Preceptists. But the
general tendency is even more comprehensive, if not yet
catholic. In consequence, very mainly, of Dryden’s own
magnificent championship of Shakespeare and Milton, it was,
by the beginning of the eighteenth century, felt in England that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_561'>561</span>these two at any rate had to be reckoned with; while Chaucer
also had the same powerful recommendation, and Spenser had
never lost the affection of the fit, though for a time they might
be few. With these four to be somehow or other—by hook or
by crook—taken into consideration, it was impossible for the
worst harm to be done; and the peculiarities of English character,
combined with the more vigorous condition of English
creative literature, made the compromise work far better than
that which had been in a manner entertained in Spain on the
subject of Lope and Calderon. It might have been dangerous
if Johnson had written the <cite>Lives</cite> at the age which was Pope’s
when he wrote the <cite>Essay on Criticism</cite>; but this danger also the
Fortune of England—kindest of Goddesses, and most abused in
her kindness, yet justified of Fate!—averted.</p>

<p class='c000'>We shall, it is to be hoped, be able to show in the next
volume how these conditions of Classicism in the several
countries affected the rise or resurrection of Romanticism.
For the present we must confine ourselves to the way in
which they affected Classicism itself.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the purpose we need not repeat, or even recapitulate,
what has been said of its fortunes in Germany, Italy, and Spain,
save to say that in the first-named country it only appeared to
disappear, while in the other two it suffered increasing decrepitude.
England and France are much more important and
interesting subjects of consideration and comparison.</p>

<p class='c000'>In both, as we saw, Neo-classicism is undoubtedly the accepted
orthodoxy of the time. If that draft confession of Faith,
which has been sketched in a former page, had been laid before
an assembly of the leading men of letters in both countries,
many might have taken exception to its actual form; but as for
its spirit, there is hardly a Frenchman who would have refused
to accept it, while not many Englishmen would have done so.
At the same time—until, towards the later years of the century,
the “alarums and excursions” of the Romantic rising recalled
the orthodox to strictness—a more searching examination would
have revealed serious defections and latitudinarianisms. Pope
was perhaps the most orthodox neo-classic, in criticism as in
creation, of the greater men of letters of the time; but Pope
<span class='pageno' id='Page_562'>562</span>was fond of Spenser. Addison had never thoroughly cleared his
mind up about criticism; but many things in him point the
Romantic way, and we know that some of the more orthodox
thought him weak and doubtful. Voltaire, at one time, had
considerable leanings towards both Shakespeare and Milton; and
we have seen how Johnson, though he resisted and recovered
himself, was at least once within appreciable distance of that
precipice of “judging by the event,” over which, when a Classic
once lets himself slip, he falls for ever and for ever through the
Romantic void.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of lesser men we need not speak much—reference to
what has been said above of the escapades of Fontenelle
and Marmontel, of Steele and Kames, is sufficient.
But all these things were as the liberalities of a securely
established orthodoxy, estated and endowed, dreading no disturbance,
and able to be generous to others—even to indulge
itself a little in licence and peccadillo. Everywhere but
in England the vast majority of men, and even in England
all but a very small minority, had no doubt about the general
principles of the Neo-classic Creed. They still judged by
Rules and Kinds; they still had the notion that you must
generalise, always generalise; they still believed that, in some
way or other, Homer and Virgil—especially Virgil—had
exhausted the secrets of Epic, and almost of poetry; and, above
all, they were entirely unprepared to extend patient and unbiassed
judgment to something acknowledged, and acknowledging
itself, to be <em>new</em>. On the contrary, they must still be vindicating
even things which they liked, but which appeared to
them to be novel, on the score of their being so very like the
old—as we saw in the case of Blair and <cite>Ossian</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Nemesis of this their Correctness, as far as creation is
concerned, in prose to some extent, but still more in verse, has
been described over and over again by a thousand critics and
literary historians. The highest and most poetical poetry they
could not write at all—except when they had, like Collins, and
Smart, and Blake, a little not merely of <span lang="la"><i>furor poeticus</i></span>, but of
actual insanity in their constitution, or when they violated their
own rules by transgressing into pure nature-poetry or into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_563'>563</span>intense realism of anthropology. In their own chosen way they
could at best achieve the really poetical rhetoric, but at the same
time strictly rhetorical poetry, of Pope, and, in a lower range, of
Akenside.<a id='r744'></a><a href='#f744' class='c019'><sup>[744]</sup></a> For prose they had the luck to discover, in the Novel,
a Kind which, never having been to any great extent practised
before, was a Kind practically without rules, and so could make
or neglect its rules for itself. In another, not quite so new,
their performance gave striking instance of their limitations.
The Periodical Essay was a thing of almost infinite possibilities:
but because it had happened at first to be written in a certain
form by persons of genius, they turned practice into Kind and
Rule once more, and for nearly the whole century—not merely
in England—went on imitating the <cite>Spectator</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Criticism itself the effects were not wholly different, though
of course to some extent apparently dissimilar. We have seen
how, during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the necessary
and ineluctable set of the critical current towards full
and free “judging of authors” seems to have been resisted by a
sort of unconscious recalcitrance on the part of critics; yet how
they are drawn nearer and nearer to it, and, in Dryden’s case at
any rate, achieve admirable results. By the eighteenth, in all
countries, the tendency becomes irresistible. The interest in
literature, the bent and occupations of men of letters great and
small, the new institution of periodicals—all combine to
strengthen it: and every kind of critical estimate, from the
elaborate literary history to the brief review, begins to be
written, and is written, ever more copiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was what criticism wanted; and it could not but do
good. Yet the results illustrated, as mere abstract treatises never
could have done, the deficiencies of the common critical theory.
The writers save themselves, as a rule, from the worst mistakes
by simply ignoring that of which they are ignorant. But in
regard to the things with which they do deal the inadequacy
and the hamper of their theory are sufficiently apparent.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course the deficiencies of Eighteenth-century criticism are
to be easily matched with other, and sometimes opposite, deficiencies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_564'>564</span>in other times. It takes considerably more pains to
get at something like a real appreciation of its subject, something
more than a bare reference to schedule, than had been the
case, either in ancient times or in the two centuries immediately
preceding. It is very much better furnished with a
critical theory (whether good or bad does not at the moment
matter) than has usually been the case with Criticism from
the early years of the nineteenth century to the early years of
the twentieth. It is not even intentionally ignorant—its ignorance
only proceeds from a mistaken estimate of things as worth
or not worth knowing; and there is rarely to be found in it
the bland assumption that “I like this,” or perhaps rather, “I
choose to say I like this,” will settle everything, which has been
not entirely unknown later. But it combines, in a fashion
already perhaps sufficiently illustrated, the awkwardness of
dogmatism and of compromise; and it is perhaps more exposed
to those two terrible questions, “Why?” and “Why
Not?” which are the Monkir and Nakir of all critics and all
criticism, than the criticism of any other period. It is difficult
to see how a critic such as Dennis could give any reasons for
admiring Shakespeare at all, save ethical ones; and it is quite
certain that a persistent <span lang="la"><i>Te sequar</i></span> with the “Why Not?” will
dispose of almost all the stock eighteenth-century objections
both to Shakespeare and to all other suspected persons. In a
certain way La Harpe had the advantage of all his predecessors,
for he was at least consistent.</p>

<p class='c000'>The theory not merely of the <i>authades kallos</i>, the “head-strong
beauty,” but of the “monstrous beauty”—the beauty
which is beautiful but has no business to be so, the miracle-working
power which does work miracles, but is to be forbidden
as <span lang="la"><i>magia nigra</i></span>, because it does not work them according to the
rules—may seem itself so monstrous as to be a patent <span lang="la"><i>reductio
ad absurdum</i></span>. In fact it acted as such. Yet the logic of it is
undeniable. It had all along been the unspoken word, but the
word that ought to have been spoken, and had to be spoken
some day. Nor need we grudge the admission that it was in a
certain sense better than the practice (which had been often
resorted to before, and which has not seldom been resorted to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_565'>565</span>since) of absolutely denying the beauty altogether, with the
possible result of being, after a time, honestly unable to
see it.</p>

<p class='c000'>A certain number of points, affecting the criticism and the
taste of the Eighteenth century in particular, remains to be
noticed briefly before we pass to the consideration of the Neo-classic
Dispensation generally.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the first place, both could not fail to be influenced most
powerfully by the constant growth of literature in volume; by
the appearance, almost for the first time in large numbers, of
the man of letters by profession; and, lastly, by certain changes
in general education, and so in the quality of writers and readers.
To say that the general reader first made his appearance about
1660, in what were to be thenceforward the two great literary
countries of Europe, would be an exaggeration, but only an
exaggeration, of the truth. He certainly increased and multiplied
in both thenceforward; and, by an inevitable consequence,
at once created the vocation of the writer and determined the
cast and quality of the things written. Matters like the continued
<span lang="fr"><i>engouement</i></span> of the French court and French society for
literature, and the alternate exaltation and depression, the Secretaryships
of State and the Grub Street kennels, for it in England,
only concern us indirectly; but they do concern us. Prosperity
and patronage enticed the literary man to work; poverty and
contempt drove him to it, if only to hack-work. Influences
came, too, from the subdivision of Kinds, the specialisation
of study required, the reduction of mere erudition among those
who were not specialists. I should suppose that, taking the
average reading of those who had any reading at all, the late
sixteenth century, with a great part of the seventeenth, was
the most erudite time in the known history of the world. The
level of general erudition has been constantly declining since,
though with some fluctuations; and it was at a specially low
level during the later eighteenth century. Although it is an
auxiliary on whose aid Romantic criticism—or rather that
catholic criticism which is neither Classic nor Romantic exclusively,
but both and more than both—can by no means pride
herself, there is little doubt that the increasing neglect of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_566'>566</span>classics did help to discredit the criticism which chiefly appealed
to them; while the constantly growing attention to certain kinds
of physical science could not but tell upon the purely literary
estimate. The historical studies which were so great a characteristic
of the later century could not, again, but be powerful
unsettlers of the fixed point of view; the ever-growing popularity
of the novel was constantly lifting into greater prominence
a kind of which the ancients had practically taken no notice at all;
the equally constant development of the newspaper was always
adding writers, who knew little of ancient rules, on subjects of
which the ancients had never thought. Even without the
special literary influences which we may hope to consider in the
next Book, the general trend of habit and event made for a
change in criticism; and such a change was imperatively called
for, at once by that <span lang="la"><i>reductio ad absurdum</i></span> of neo-classic strictures,
and by that illogical tolerance of certain great writers of
the past, to which we have given the joint name and status of
its Nemesis.<a id='r745'></a><a href='#f745' class='c019'><sup>[745]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c021'>II.</h3>

<p class='c022'>We now have before us the more important, but also the
more difficult, task of summing up the achievements and the
shortcomings of the whole period covered by this volume—the
<em>only</em> period, be it remembered, in which Criticism was regarded
from the point of view of a commonly accepted, if not very
commonly understood, orthodoxy. This of itself is an advantage,
which, though it has not recently counted for very
much, will never be overlooked by true critics. Even if we
drop the <span lang="la"><i>quod semper</i></span>, the <span lang="la"><i>quod ubique, quod ab omnibus</i></span> has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_567'>567</span>a weight which leaves it wholly for the other side to show
case and cause against. Orthodoxy may be really right—really
<em>ortho</em>dox; on that head it has at least an even chance
against any of its opponents. Even if it is not, it has merits
which they can rarely claim. It has no temptations for the
clever fool, who is perhaps on the whole the most pestilent,
intellectually, of human beings. It demands a certain amount
of self-abnegation, which is always a good thing. It does not
perhaps really offer any greater temptation to the merely
stupid than does the cheap heterodoxy of other times. Above
all, it directly tends to a certain intellectual calmness—to
an absence of fuss, and worry, and pother, which is certainly
not one of the least characteristics of the Judge. At all times
the wise man would rather be orthodox than not; and at most
times, though not quite at all, the wisest men have been
orthodox, if only because they have recognised that every
opinion has some amount of truth in it, and that this truth,
<em>plus</em> the advantages of orthodoxy just mentioned, is greatest,
and should prevail.</p>

<p class='c000'>This will be recognised by all fair-minded persons as a
handsome allowance in any case; it is surely a particularly
handsome allowance when the arbiter happens not to be a
partisan of the orthodoxy in question. And it is quite sincere.
The present writer has emerged from the serious and consecutive
examination of “classical” critics, necessary for the writing
of this volume, with a distinctly higher opinion of them
generally, with a higher opinion in most cases in particular,
than he held previously on piecemeal and imperfect acquaintance.
It is only in such a case as that of Boileau—where
an almost consummate faculty of expression masks really
small critical gifts, and where the worst faults of the critical
character, personal rudeness and spite, are continually lurking
behind what seem to be systematic judgments—that the result
of the reading has gone the other way. At the same time,
if we take the true reading of <span lang="la"><i>illud Syrianum</i></span>, “<span lang="la">Judex damnatur
[<i>capitis</i> cum [<i>in</i>]nocens [<i>culpatur vel minime</i>],</span>” then the case
of the criticism with which we have been dealing becomes
somewhat parlous. It is all the worse because its worsening is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_568'>568</span>gradual and continuous. The sins of the earliest Renaissance
criticism are sins chiefly of neglect, and are not as a rule
aggravated by commission; while its merits are very great.
We could have done nothing without it: at best we should
have had to do for ourselves all that it has done for us. But
the bad side of the matter betrays itself in the code-making
of the seventeenth century; it is but imperfectly and unsatisfactorily
disguised in the compromises of the earlier
eighteenth; and it appears in all its deformity in the La
Harpian recrudescence.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fault of the whole is undoubtedly but an aggravation
of what in Ancient Criticism could hardly be called with
justice a fault at all, though it was even there a serious defect—the
absence, that is to say, of a wide enough collection
of instances from the past, and of an elastic and tolerant
system of trial and admission for the present and future. We
may <em>now</em><a id='r746'></a><a href='#f746' class='c019'><sup>[746]</sup></a> use the word “fault” almost without qualification,
proviso, or apology. The Greek could not, and the Roman
until very late days could only to a most limited extent,
exercise the proper sweep of observation and comparison; the
man of the earlier Middle Ages was, from different causes,
prevented from doing so to any effect. But the contemporaries
of Lilius Giraldus who knew (or knew of) Chaucer and Wyatt—still
more, in the next generation, those of Patrizzi who knew
Ronsard and the Pléiade—could plead no such exemption or
excuse. They had recovered the exacter knowledge of the
remoter past which the Middle Ages lacked, the critical spirit
which during the Middle Ages was asleep: and they had
accumulated and were accumulating treasures, of completed
mediæval work and of modern work constantly accruing, enough
to give them every comparison, without exception, that they
could have wanted. Their guilt was deepening daily as their
opportunities increased.</p>

<p class='c000'>For they neglected these opportunities, they “sinned” these
mercies, almost without exception. If England in any way
deserved the good fortune that fell to her at the close of the
eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth, it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_569'>569</span>because she had never wholly denied either Chaucer or Spenser,
either Shakespeare or Milton. But the just men who thus
saved her were wofully few, and they were almost all of them
followers of Naaman, who extorted a permission to bow in the
house of Rimmon, rather than of the glorious Three Children,
who would do obeisance to no graven image that any king set
up. If Germany had the honour of leading the way—or very
nearly leading the way—in the Critical Reformation, it was
because, from the very beginning of her really modern literature,
she had put faith in her <span lang="de"><cite>Heldenbuch</cite></span> and her <span lang="de"><cite>Bergreihen</cite></span>. But
even this faith was rather hesitating for a long time, and it
had no foothold in courtly, and curial, and academic places.
The men who were the real pioneers in the revival or commencement
of that universal study of literature which alone
can lead to a universal criticism, were as a rule mere scholars
and antiquaries, men like Oldys and Capell, La Monnoye and
Sainte-Palaye, Sanchez and Sedano. Gray, the greatest man
of letters by far who at least fumbled with the key of the
enchanted garden, did but fumble with that key: and his
successors Percy and Warton, who opened what they could,
were not great men of letters at all. Abroad, and especially in
France, their analogues, such as Marmontel, never got so far
even as they did. In Spain it became fashionable to deny
Lope if not Cervantes: in Italy Dante-worship was too often,
if not in most cases, lip-worship only.</p>

<p class='c000'>The spectacle of these centuries is almost infinitely interesting
and surprising. I cannot, after having, with not a little
pains, attained to some Pisgah-sight of it, exhaust my own
wonder, especially in regard to the Eighteenth, or disentangle
myself from that fatalism which I have already—with the
result of some misunderstanding in the house of no un-friends—announced
at the end of the First volume. We can understand
the Sixteenth century, with its vernaculars hardly yet
fully formed, with their greatest literature coming and to come,
with an almost excusable distaste for the immediate past, and
with the full eagerness—the honeymoon intoxication—of their
intercourse with the classics upon them—we can understand
this being excessive in admitting, in continuing, in caricaturing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_570'>570</span>the critical principles of the classics themselves. We can
also, if not quite so fully, understand how the dwindling enthusiasms
of the Seventeenth, with its still greater sense of
“the petty done, the undone vast” in the matter of mere
erudition, and its thick-coming concerns of party politics,
material progress, physical science, rivalry of nations, and the
like—we can understand its sinking, in mid-journey or thereabouts,
to an “age of prose and sense,” where the prose was
as certain as the sense was sometimes problematical. But the
Eighteenth was beginning to be disengaged, to specialise, to
take stock, to disuse the Chronicle and begin the History.
How, we must ask ourselves, could men like Muratori and
Gravina, like Addison and Johnson, like Fontenelle and Du
Bos, rest even partly satisfied (for wholly, as we have seen,
some of them at least were not) with literary sealed patterns
which admittedly would not fit the greatest admitted literature
of all their respective countries except France, and which presented,
to the not insufficient self-sufficiency of Frenchmen, the
proposition that, for hundreds of years, French men of letters
had been barbarians, if not idiots?</p>

<p class='c000'>There is no explanation but Grandgousier’s, eked a little by
the remembrance that—as we shall, it is to be hoped, see in the
next volume—there <em>was</em> a searching of hearts, a moving of the
waters, not very late, in fact very early, in the Eighteenth
century itself. But, as we have seen already, the creed of
the majority, the orthodoxy of the time, admitted no hint of
this. It made a few concessions or extensions—till it found
them obviously unsafe—in the direction of amiable but illogical
compromise in particulars. It yielded up no jot of the general
creed. It was still matter of breviary <span lang="la"><i>circa</i></span> 1780, as it had
begun to be <span lang="la"><i>circa</i></span> 1580, that the Fable was the Poem (let us say
that if Homer had written an argument of the <cite>Iliad</cite>, and had
left off there, he would have done all that was actually necessary);
that you must follow Nature by following the ancients;
that you must not use epic verse in non-epic poetry, and so
forth. In all countries, or almost all,—the extreme literary
poverty and disarray of Germany here serving her in good
stead,—these general assumptions, and the many others which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_571'>571</span>have been noticed in the foregoing pages, had narrowed down
to yet others of the particular kind—that the pause in an
English verse must be absolutely within a syllable or two of
the middle; that a French Alexandrine must not have the
impudence to overflow into its neighbour; and the like. And
the whole sums itself up all the more strikingly—because of
the doubtful and argumentative tone of the passage—in that
memorable decision of Johnson’s which has been discussed
above, the decision justifying Rymer, justifying La Harpe,
that we must not “judge by the event,”—that the presence of
the fig is no proof of the nature of the fig-tree.</p>

<p class='c000'>No very elaborate indications of the faults inseparable from
this style of criticism can be necessary. That if carried out
rigorously (as in some instances at least it was) it would simply
have sterilised and petrified the literary production of the world,
is of course obvious. That journey <span lang="fr"><i>au fond de l’inconnu pour
trouver du nouveau</i></span>, which, with whatever success or failure it may
meet, however dangerous it may be in some high functions and
departments of Life and Thought, is the motive principle of
Art, was barred by it at once. It was no question of “progress”
in the very likely chimerical sense of improvement; there was
to be not even any <em>difference</em>. “To-morrow” was not, according
to the proverb, to be “a new day”: if the men of this school did
not go as far as Musette and pronounce that <span lang="fr"><i>Demain, c’est une
fatuité du calendrier</i></span>, they held that it was to be as yesterday,
and much more also. It is equally obvious that this doctrine
positively invited indulgence in some of the worst faults of
criticism. The critic who nowadays compasses all the reference
shelves of the British Museum in order to find one discrepancy
with his author, and then triumphs over him, is mostly confined
to dates and names, or to more or less transparent erections of
personal opinion (or personal ignorance) into standards, which
the fairly intelligent reader takes for what they are worth. A
hundred and fifty years ago the child of Momus had much better
cards in his hand. The “exact scales of Bossu” were not only
infinitely complicated and elaborate, but people in general, however
intelligent, were by no means inclined to find any fault
with them or question their justice. He had a hundred chances,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_572'>572</span>to one that he now has, of catching his author tripping under
statute, and without any actual garbling or dishonesty.</p>

<p class='c000'>But between the dangers on the great scale and the dangers
on the small, which have been indicated in the last paragraph,
there were many of intermediate kinds. Without absolute
distrust of novelty or unfamiliarity as such on the one hand,
and without a mere peddling tendency to pick holes on the
other, a critic under this dispensation might, and almost must,
find himself distracted, hampered, wellnigh mantrapped, in his
critical investigations. A dreamlike network or chain of obsessions
was upon him. To submit himself frankly to the
effect of the work and judge it as he would a prospect or a
picture,<a id='r747'></a><a href='#f747' class='c019'><sup>[747]</sup></a> a vintage or a face, was forbidden him. It was his
duty, in the first place, if the author openly classed his work
in any Kind, to decide whether it really belonged to this or to
another; if the author had omitted that ceremony, to determine
the classification sedulously for himself. Then he had to remember,
or look up, the most celebrated ancient examples of the
Kind, or those modern ones which had obtained the credit of
being most like the ancients; and to decide whether the resemblance
was sufficient in general. And then he had to
descend—if descent be possible in this process of grovelling—to
particulars, and see if <em>they</em> were “according to Cocker.”
If everything were entirely <span lang="fr"><i>en règle</i></span>, he was at liberty to admire
and enjoy, supposing that, after the preliminaries, he had any
disposition towards admiration and enjoyment left in him.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is not a caricature; it is absolutely exact according
to the “regulation” theory: and as the examples quoted before
will have shown, and as hundreds of others might be produced
to show, it is by no means untrue to practice. A critic, great,
or generous, or happily both, might transcend his brief, be better
than his creed, as in that noble eulogy of Gray’s <cite>Elegy</cite> which
makes up for much in Johnson’s <cite>Life</cite> of the poet. But these
were works of supererogation; and it is not quite certain that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_573'>573</span>the exercise of them was entirely orthodox. The “stop-watch”
<em>was</em> orthodox: it was the very centre and pulse of the machine
of neo-classic criticism.</p>

<p class='c000'>I do not think that it is part of my duty as a Historian to
support this view by any further argument. I have given the
strongest possible, in a minute, and I believe faithful, exposition
of the <em>actual</em> survey, the <em>actual</em> opinions, the <em>actual</em> processes
and judgments of neo-classic critics. If it is necessary to say
any more, let it be this only. The weakness of their position
is sufficiently shown by the fact that it could not bear the light
of a historical knowledge of literature. There was none such,
so long as it lasted: and when that light shone, it fell. The
coincidences may not be causative; but it is for others to
show that they are not.</p>

<p class='c000'>If, however, any one should conclude from these strictures
that, in the view of the present writer, the critical work of these
three centuries was only evil continually, he would make a very
great mistake. Moreover, putting all personal views out of the
question, it is certain that this could not be the case. In
almost all arts and even sciences, but in Art even more than
in Science, the task set before the human faculties is a gigantic
“Rule of False,” as the older arithmetic books called it, in
which, by following out certain hypotheses, and ascertaining
how and to what extent you are led wrong by them, you at last
discover the right way. The most grotesque error is thus a
benefit to Humanity, which, indeed, sometimes shows itself conscious
enough of the beneficial character to perform the experiment
over and over again. And further, in all arts and in all
sciences, but especially in the higher division of Art, the reward
of these excursions is not confined to the somewhat negative
advantage of discovering that man need go that way no more.
Corollaries and episodes—wayside windfalls of the Muses—await,
not so thinly spread, the adventurous and single-hearted
practitioner of Allegory as of Alchemy, on the acrostic as on the
astrolabe. And considering the secondary or parasitic character
which so specially belongs to Criticism, it is inevitable, not
merely that these “bonuses,” these “extras,” should be more
abundant here than anywhere else, but that the regular profits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_574'>574</span>of the ordinary work should be considerable. Unless the critic is
utterly incompetent and bad—unless he is a very Rymer, I do
not say a Dennis, much less a Boileau—his mere contact with a
new work of art must result in something useful, in a critical
datum and fact for the future. It is very unlikely—if he is a
person of even rather more than average brains it is practically
impossible—that the exact equation or conjunction of his temperament,
and his equipment, and the character of the work,
will ever recur. It is, <span lang="la"><i>ex hypothesi</i></span>, quite certain that it can
never have occurred before. That he judges under a certain
system, even a wrong one, will not detract from the value of the
result, save in quantity. There will still be the actual fact—acquired
to the stock of critical data for the future—that a
critical power, say A, applied under the restrictions of system
<i>m</i> or <i>n</i>, to work B, has resulted in the judgment <i>x</i>. And this
result, in its own line and sphere, is as much a “thing,” and a
thing of interest, to the critical student of literature, as a new
beetle to the man of science, or a new judgment of the House
of Lords to the man of law. Nay, to such a student it has
a higher interest still: it is in rank and line (<span lang="la"><i>mutatis mutandis</i></span>
again) with the work criticised, with a picture, with a sonata, as
a thing of art itself.</p>

<p class='c000'>And critics in these centuries, from these points of view and
others, estated criticism more richly than it could have hoped
to be endowed when the Humanists began once more to attack
and defend Poetry, or when Daniello a little later set himself
down to write the first treatise of criticism proper in a vernacular
language. They attempted, and to the best of their power
arranged, the more general questions of the Art, always with
zeal, if not always with discretion; they did valuable, if
also somewhat and sometimes mistaken, work in its intermediate
regions; and slowly, grudgingly, but surely, they set
themselves to the apparently humbler but really fruitful work
of actual critical examination of literature, at first as it had been
provided and already criticised long ago, at last as it was being
provided by the flying day. Their own theories, right or
wrong, they worked out with altogether admirable patience and
thoroughness, applying them, too, with a faithfulness which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_575'>575</span>must excite admiration, if it cannot command agreement. And,
as we have taken all fair pains to show, they not unfrequently
strayed and stumbled upon outside truths, leant over the border
of their somewhat narrow world and pried into others, after a
fashion which, when the due time came, was sure to start more
adventurous discoverers on wider paths of exploration.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would be superfluous to extend this already long volume
with any list of selected specimens of individual achievement
and excellence. I hope, indeed, that this book may attract
or help attention to some critics—Capriano, Cinthio, Patrizzi,
Ogier are a very few examples—who are at present very little
known: and to others, unnecessary to specify, whose claims
have, as it seems to me, been underrated or misunderstood.
But I have included, I think, no one of all the hundreds appearing
in this volume who is not profitable in some way, for example,
or for correction, or for reproof—who has not done something,
if it be only in the way of warning, to help the student of
all time.</p>

<p class='c000'>We may also advantageously compare this balance-sheet with
the balance-sheets of Ancient Criticism as given before, and of
Modern in an anticipated draft. As compared with the former,
Neo-Classicism has the disadvantage that, with at least equal if
not greater narrowness, it is almost entirely destitute of the same
excuse for being narrow. The Greeks of the great age wrote
with nothing but Greek literature before them; those of the
decadence and the Romans with nothing but Greek literature
and Roman, which was for the most part a pale copy of Greek.
The men of the eighteenth century, had they chosen, could have
compared, with the practice and the theory of these two literatures,
not merely the vast, the interesting, and, as “correcting”
classicism, the inestimable literature of the Middle Ages, but at
least four substantive and important literatures of modern times,
those of France, Italy, England, and Spain. They not only did
not do this as a matter of fact, but they invariably in practice,
and not seldom as a matter of express theory, flouted and scouted
the bare idea of doing it. They persisted in applying a travesty
of the system of Horace, itself travestied from Aristotle, to these
totally different products. Sometimes this resulted in the bland
<span class='pageno' id='Page_576'>576</span>absurdity of the <cite>Battle of the Books</cite> attitude, sometimes in the
hardly less ludicrous compromise which, by stretching the
faults-and-beauties doctrine to its farthest possible extent,
allowed critics to make room, as it were by sufferance, for
Shakespeare and Milton, for Dante and Cervantes. They
could laugh heartily at a dinner in the style of the ancients,
and their common-sense would at once have pronounced any
one fit for Bedlam who attempted to journey from London to
York bareheaded, clothed in a toga, and with sandals on foot;
but in theory, and even partly in practice, they imposed the
classical uniform on literature.</p>

<p class='c000'>Still, they show, at least in some respects, better beside their
modern successors than it is the fashion to think. We have
opened the road which they barred, and permitted the exploration
of the countries which they forbade; but it is rather a
question whether we have profited as we should by this gain.
It is still the very rarest thing to find a critic who, by equipment
or even by inclination, is himself disposed to take a really
catholic view of literature; and those who do endeavour to take
such a view are constantly regarded with distrust by the general,
and with a rather comic rancour by specialists. It follows that
the modern critic is, taking each on his own scheme, very much
less well prepared as a rule than the critic, not merely of the
eighteenth century, as has been said above, but of our period
generally, and very nearly as liable as that critic was to take
hasty sweeping views in condemnation of whole provinces of his
subject.</p>

<p class='c000'>Excesses, moreover, of this kind, which critics from the Renaissance
onwards committed, are a natural result of reaction
in all histories. And in the History of Literature a hundred
years of something approaching to Anarchy are perhaps not
too much to balance three hundred of mistakenly experimental
Order. We shall see the causes and the faults, as well as the
excuses and the gains, of the Anarchy later. For the present
it is fitting to conclude, with an acknowledgment anew of the
merits of the Order also, in respect to the faults of which we
have been so frank. They are the merits of a remarkable
industry, of a commendable freedom from mere dilettantism, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_577'>577</span>the discovery of not a few sound critical principles, and the
registration of not a few sound critical judgments, of an experimentation
and accomplishment which, even if it went wrong,
serves as an invaluable warning to other ages not to pursue the
paths which have so misled. And, yet once more, let us recognise
that adjustment of criticism to creation—mysterious or
simply natural as it may seem to different temperaments and
different systems of thought—which we have observed before,
in the cautious check of Renaissance criticism on the heady
exuberance of the great Renaissance creation, in the support
given by Seventeenth-century classicism to such mediate powers
and dispositions as those of Corneille and even Racine, of Dryden
and even Pope; in the salutary deterrence of Eighteenth-century
orthodoxy, which saved us from more Beatties and more Anne
Radcliffes when the time was not ready for Keatses or for Scotts.
For so also in literature—and even in that, as some would have
it, not divinest part of literature, Criticism—do all the works
of the Lord, the lesser as well as the greater, praise Him and
magnify Him for ever.</p>

think, in connection with the work of

Gottschedising in this sense, and proposing
to judge the worth or worthlessness

lines. I have seen an excellent

“showing how to <em>do</em> something”—as
if he were a dancing-master.</p>
